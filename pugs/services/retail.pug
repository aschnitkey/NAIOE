Rigid requirements dictated both by state law and customer convenience narrowed the property parameters significantly, but NAI Ohio Equities persevered and gave us great options along with great expertise in the market. Additionally, they were able to negotiate a contract that gave us the time we needed to entitle the property to allow for the required zoning and street access. Over all, working with NAI Ohio Equities was a great experience."
