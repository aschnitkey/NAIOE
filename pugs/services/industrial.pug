								p.testimonial--body "NAI Ohio Equities did a great job assisting us with our expansion into the Columbus, Ohio, Market.  We had our sights set on a location but our timing was moved up due to our client’s needs.  We found that this space would not be ready in time to meet with our client’s timeline, but the NAI Ohio Equities team adjusted quickly to find us a new property that was able to meet the timing demand. Their market knowledge and ability to adapt helped us secure a great warehouse/distribution facility in Columbus."
