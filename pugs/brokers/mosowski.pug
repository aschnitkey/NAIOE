								hr
								h5 What do you like most about Commercial Real Estate?
								p The people and relationships. Everyone thinks we are just in sales, however, that is not entirely true.  Yes, sales are a part of the business, however the people and relationships are far more important than the next sale.  Getting to know my clients and what their problems are, what their motivation is, and what their pain points are allow me to fully understand their needs and deliver successful results.  The relationships that I have been able to make in this industry are irreplaceable. Conversations I have with my clients, peers, lenders, or appraisers tend to be 10% business and 90% catching up on each other’s lives or relationship building.
								h5 Describe a memorable transaction.
								p The sale of 800-830 Distribution Drive.  800-830 Distribution Drive was the first industrial property and industrial owner I ever worked for; the original assignment was to lease a 7,200 SF space.  During my first showing there I remember walking through the space in the dark using my flip phone as a light to find the breaker box, flipped the breakers for the lights and there was the sweet sound of the buzzing Metal Halide lighting.  I leased that space, and over the next 10 years I re-leased that space twice more, and also leased the other 52,800 SF in those buildings multiple times over.  I discussed selling the building with the owner many times over the years and finally in 2016 it was time. We put the building in contract three times, twice it fell out and finally the third time it sold.  My client (Jerry) was the first industrial owner I had ever worked for and we had developed a decade long relationship, so when it was time to sell it was a bit bittersweet.

								h5 Why did you decide to make Central Ohio your home? 
								p My move to Columbus was supposed to be temporary, however after living here for a couple months and seeing the growth potential, I decided to stay.  Growing up outside of Cleveland was fine, however, in the early 2000s my hometown was headed downward and Columbus upward.  It was a new city with a ton of energy and excitement I did not see back home, and those trends have continued and I believe will continue for a while.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p Tennessee – On one side you can visit the mountains, hike, see wildlife and spend time in nature, and on the other side there is Nashville, which is a super cool city with lots to do.  It is also an easy drive from Columbus and there is something for everyone in the family to do.
								h5 What’s a favorite pastime you enjoy?
								p Spending time with my family is absolutely the best part of any day!  My wife and two daughters keep me going on a daily basis and anytime with them is cherished.
								h5 Who are your favorite sports teams?
								p Stewart Hass Racing.  I have been a Tony Stewart fan since day 1, and now that he is retired, I’m a fan of any driver that races for his team.

								p.tstimonial-bio-quote "Matt Osowski and the Industrial Property Team did a great job assisting us with our expansion into the Columbus, Ohio, Market. We had our sights set on a location but our timing was moved up due to our client’s needs. We found that this space would not be ready in time to meet with our client’s timeline, but Matt and his team adjusted quickly to find us a new property that was able to meet the timing demand. Matt’s market knowledge and ability to adapt helped us secure a great warehouse/distribution facility in Columbus."
								p.testimonial-bio-source Jesse Kaufman, CEO &amp; Founder
								h5.testimonial-bio-company Oscar W. Larson Co
								p.tstimonial-bio-quote "Matt Osowski and his team were very knowledgeable about the market and were able to provide us with all the options possible for our relocation. After several tours, Matt identified a space that was on the market, however, the landlord did not want to split the space to our suitable size. We toured the space and worked diligently with the landlord to find an agreement that worked for both parties. Matt understood our needs and was able to clearly explain the landlord's objective to reach a common ground."

Not only did Matt go above and beyond in finding the right spot for us but was very patient and honest when it came to what fit best for our business and long-term needs. His knowledge of the Columbus area, overall state of the industry, and advice throughout the negotiation was first class. Matt always made himself available when needed and was very thorough from start to end. Will definitely be referring him and his agency to others looking for a best in class commercial real-estate experience."

								p.tstimonial-bio-quote "Matt and Curt gave us a set of expectations then promptly exceeded all of them.

We would happily return to them for our leasing work across Columbus."

								h5.testimonial-bio-company Honda Logistics
								p.testimonial-bio-quote "We have worked with the Industrial Property Team since 2012 and they have helped negotiate two new leases.  Each time they understood our need to be in a specific geographic area and knew there were limited options that would fit our requirement.  They completed an extensive search, organized the data, and prepared it so it was easy for me to review.  Once a building was chosen, they assisted in the lease negotiation. Their market knowledge is invaluable and key to us feeling confident in our decisions.  I would be happy to recommend them to anyone with industrial needs in the area."

From leasing 20,000 SF on a month-to month basis or selling our 340,000 SF Class A building. Their commitment, determination and market knowledge allowed us to achieve our goals.

My business partner and I really appreciated all of their good work and dependability.
