								p.testimonial-bio-quote "NAI-OE and Matt Osowski were extremely patient, helpful and determined to find us the right location and landlord for our special project.  The unique requirements and specifications for our space meant that the number of available sites were limited, Matt was never deterred in his efforts and I can’t thank him and NAI enough!"

								p.testimonial-bio-quote "We have worked with the Industrial Property Team since 2012 and they have helped negotiate two new leases.  Each time they understood our need to be in a specific geographic area and knew there were limited options that would fit our requirement.  They completed an extensive search, organized the data, and prepared it so it was easy for me to review.  Once a building was chosen, they assisted in the lease negotiation. Their market knowledge is invaluable and key to us feeling confident in our decisions.  I would be happy to recommend them to anyone with industrial needs in the area."

								p.testimonial-bio-quote "We wanted to express our thanks to the Industrial Property Team for their excellent service over the past 15 years.  The Industrial Property Team have consistently understood our business and its challenges. Whether it is helping to locate a short term warehouse space or assisting in selling our buildings, their dedication to representing our best interests has always been appreciated.  We have asked the Industrial Property Team to do a little of everything over the years and the Industrial Property Team have treated each assignment with equal importance.  From leasing 20,000 SF on a month-to month basis or selling our 340,000 SF Class A building. Their commitment, determination and market knowledge allowed us to achieve our goals.

									| One of their most important traits is their honesty.  It is difficult in these times to maintain a moral compass.  Theirs is fine-tuned and on the mark all the time. When we combine this trait with their loyalty, it sets the Industrial Property Team head and shoulders above all others.  My business partner and I really appreciated all of their good work and dependability.

I sincerely appreciate the partnership and drive the Industrial Property Team bring with each new project.
