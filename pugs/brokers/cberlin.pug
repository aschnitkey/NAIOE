								h5.testimonial-bio-company HF Group
								p.testimonial-bio-quote "NAI-OE and the Industrial Property Team were extremely patient, helpful and determined to find us the right location and landlord for our special project.  The unique requirements and specifications for our space meant that the number of available sites were limited, the team was never deterred in their efforts and I can’t thank them and NAI enough!"

								h5.testimonial-bio-company Honda Logistics
								p.testimonial-bio-quote "We have worked with Curt since 2012 and he has helped negotiate two new leases.  Each time he understood our need to be in a specific geographic area and knew there were limited options that would fit our requirement.  He completed an extensive search, organized the data, and prepared it so it was easy for me to review.  Once a building was chosen, he assisted in the lease negotiation.  His market knowledge is invaluable and key to us feeling confident in our decisions.  I would be happy to recommend him to anyone with industrial needs in the area."
