								p Chad Boggs joins NAI Ohio Equities after spending more than 15 years in information technology in the logistics and retail sectors. As a small business owner, Chad has experience as both a landlord and commercial tenant, which led to the discovery of his passion for commercial real estate.

								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home? 
								p I was born and raised in Columbus, having graduated from Hilliard Davidson High School.  After graduating from Ohio University, I knew I wanted to be in Columbus long term. Columbus offers a thriving arts and cultural scene with numerous museums, theaters, sporting events, and festivals throughout the year. I love the balance between urban amenities and the suburban feel that Columbus offers.  
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p Every year my family takes a trip to that state up North which includes copious amounts of boating, swimming, fishing, and relaxing. We love the crystal-clear lakes, sunsets on the water, and just enjoying quality family time only a short drive from Columbus.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p I really enjoy going to Red Brick Tap &amp; Grill in Merion Village. Great food and drink menu and a wonderful patio. One of the best Reuben’s in the city!
