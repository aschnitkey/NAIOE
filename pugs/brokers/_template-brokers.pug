								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p After working on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. for two years after college, I found myself wanting to make a career change. One of my best friends suggested I should consider commercial real estate so in 2007 I got licensed and then the big recession hit. Although times were tough, it created a solid foundation for how I run my real estate practice and treat my clients with honesty, integrity and respect.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p Marco Island, FL and any of the Great Lakes regions. I prefer laid back and relaxing destinations where I can unplug and spend quality time with the family.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p Hellas Carryout in Shawnee Hills has been one of my favorite places to eat since I was in elementary school. They have the best omelettes and gyros in town.
