								h5 What do you like most about Commercial Real Estate?
								p What I like most about commercial real estate is working with owners and tenants to hep them find the space that is right for them and assist them through the process.
								h5 What has been the best part of Columbus' growth over the past few decades?
								p I grew up in Columbus and it is fun to see how much this city has grown. We have had the fortune of having good city leaders both in the private and public sector that had the foresight to work together to make this a thriving city for business, entertainment and great neighborhoods.
								h5 Who are your favorite sports teams?
								p Of course, being from Columbus you have to follow the Buckeyes and the Blue Jackets! Iâ€™m also a fan of both the Cleveland and Cincinnati baseball and football teams, I think next year is our year!
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p We do like to travel as a family and one of our goals is to get to all 50 states, we have just a few left to go. The last visit will be Fargo, North Dakota as they have a club called the
