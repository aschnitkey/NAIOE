								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p A few reasons: I have always had an interest in real estate and when I made the decision to pursue real estate full-time I wanted to focus on Commercial because of my recent experience selling media. I really enjoy working with business owners and coming up with creative solutions to help them overcome obstacles.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p I moved to Columbus from Michigan to attend Ohio State. After spending four great years at Ohio State University and meeting my wife, it was an easy choice to call Columbus home. Living in the Short North is very vibrant and exciting with no shortage of things to do.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p Hilton Head Island- I enjoy the beach, the ocean, and great golf courses.
