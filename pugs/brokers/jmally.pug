								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p I have a strong appreciation for all types of construction, development, and the entrepreneurial strategy that brings it together.  In my ten years of working with contractors and developers across Ohio, I developed a dedicated interest in site selection, commercial property, and the negotiation of a deal. After an introduction to Ohio Equities President and broker Mike Simpson, my passion and stewardship for Columbus real estate continued to grow leading to an exciting career path.
									br
									br
									| I believe that businesses of every size and shape play an integral part in our economy and deserve the highest level of customer service through that process. With the new corridors thriving in Central Ohio, the growing workforce, modernized retail, and motivated entrepreneurs, Columbus is an exciting area to engage in commercial real estate.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p Columbus has always been my home as I grew up on Eastmoor Blvd and graduated from Bishop Hartley.  After returning from four years at Bowling Green it was exciting to see how quickly the city had changed.   With the revitalization of the Short north and downtown both in full swing I wanted nothing more than to make my mark in my hometown. Entering into my marriage, we both had a dream of raising a family in Bexley where we could stay close to family, the Buckeyes and access to the exciting new hotspots here in Columbus.
								h5 Can you describe a memorable transaction?
								p In 2017 I began assisting Fortner Upholstery in locating a larger facility, as they had outgrown two buildings and were continuing to expand. We explored multiple options and landed on a 232,000sf building that was in need of some love, but had plenty of room for growth and to accommodate other businesses.  Advising the client through this 1031 exchange and acquisition has led to lots of education and many opportunities. It is now home to dozens of tenants and has been pivotal to an area of South High that has long been looked over.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p I’m a bit of a history buff so I tend to be drawn into anywhere that shows our city’s rich history. My favorite hide away is what I regard as The Top Steakhouse in Columbus and is located just outside of Bexley. They take pride in the quality of their menu and the bonus is the mad men vibe which takes you back to a bygone era. As of late though, Valter’s at the Maennerchor, has become a new favorite.   An authentic German Village landmark that many are yet to experience.
