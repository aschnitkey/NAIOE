								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p I have a strong appreciation for all types of construction, entrepreneurs, and the negotiation of a deal. In my ten years of working with contractors and developers across Ohio I grew a strong interest in site selection and commercial property. After an introduction to Ohio Equities President and broker Mike Simpson, my passion and stewardship for Columbus Real Estate grew quickly.
									br
									br
									| The new corridors thriving in Central Ohio, the growing work force, new attractive retail, and motivated entrepreneurs, are all exciting parts of being involved in commercial real estate.I believe that businesses of every size and shape play an integral part of our economy and deserve the highest level of customer service through that process.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p Columbus has always been my home since growing up on Eastmoor Blvd and attending east side Catholic Schools near Bexley. I have always absorbed every ounce of Columbus history and enjoy getting to know the many people that have made central Ohio what it is today. I appreciate the importance of every aspect of a business deal and know that the location of a building is one thing you cannot change, so choose Columbus. Go Bucks!
