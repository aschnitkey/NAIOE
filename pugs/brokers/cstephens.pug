								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p I have always found commercial real estate to be the most unique asset class. It is something you can see, feel, touch, and change. I enjoy building relationships with property owners and investors to help them get a comprehensive understanding of their asset and determine whether there is a better alternative in the marketplace.
								h5 What has been the best part of Columbus's growth over the past few decades?
								p The best part for me has been seeing the tangible transformation Columbus has gone through. You not only feel the growth but actually see it through new development all around the city. I think there is tremendous opportunity for continued growth and look forward to playing an intricate part in that.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p I grew up on the East Coast. Upon graduating from Ohio University, I had to decide whether I should go back home or stay close to this place I grew fond of. I had a great support system from school who lived in Columbus, and I decided to put down roots in the state capital. Eight years later, I can confidently say I made the right decision. Columbus has so much to offer, and I am happy I found a city that matches my personality.
