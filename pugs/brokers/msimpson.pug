								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p The most rewarding part of being in the commercial real estate industry is the satisfaction that comes from consulting for clients who are making significant real estate decisions that impact their business and families.

								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p Ohio is a state of over 11,000,000 people. Central Ohio is the only region in the state with population growth, job growth, and significant new investment.
								h5 What is your favorite neighborhood/area of Columbus and why?
								p Being a Bexley native and current resident, I am definitely partial to the city that was the first municipal arboretum in the country.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p The restaurant renaissance taking place in our urban areas; progressive and affordable, what more could you want!
