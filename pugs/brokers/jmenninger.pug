								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p I’ve always known I should be in sales.  With prior appraisal experience, Commercial Real Estate was the obvious choice. The people, workflow, freedom and ability to help a client achieve their real estate needs make commercial real estate a very rewarding career.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p Columbus is a great city.  I grew up in Cincinnati and came to Columbus to attend OSU. When I graduated in 2002, I had fallen in love with the city and decided to stick around. While I miss having my family close, the majority of our friends are here in Columbus.
								h5 What is your favorite neighborhood/area of Columbus and why?
								p I live in Grandview and love the walkability and selection of so many great restaurants.  The school district is great and the city has the feel of a small town while still centrally located only a few miles from downtown, OSU and access to major freeways.

								h5.testimonial-bio-company Murray Material Handling
								p.testimonial-bio-quote We are a small family-owned company and were given a tight timeline to relocate our Columbus location. Occupancy rates were fairly high at the time, so the search was limited from the start. Joe asked a lot of questions about our business to learn what our needs were, both now and in the future, so we were able to see several properties meeting our criteria in a short period of time. As we expanded our search from leasing only to possible purchase, Joe’s experience really paid off, as we had never been down that road before. He was always available by phone or email to answer questions and guide us through the process, and he provided great referrals for both the financing and our plumbing upgrades once the purchase was complete.
								p.testimonial-bio-quote Our new property has more square feet than we needed, so we’ve been able to lease out a portion of it as well. Joe has also assisted with that process, and he continues to be a good sounding board as we grow into this building. If &amp; when the time comes to find a new property, I won’t hesitate to contact Joe again and utilize his knowledge, experience, and professionalism.
