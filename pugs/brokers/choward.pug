He prides himself on his strong market knowledge and ability to do extensive research and analysis for his Clients' needs.

With finely honed sales skills and understanding of commercial properties, Chris leased approximately 1.8 million square feet of retail space at his first brokerage firm.

								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p I have always had in an interest in real estate and have bought and flipped homes in the past. When I made the decision to pursue real estate full time I wanted to work on the commercial side since I had a background in commercial insurance. I knew I enjoyed working with business owners and wanted to continue with that path. I have always had a career in sales and enjoy the hunt and negotiation that comes with working for either the Landlord or Tenant.  Over the years I have also learned that to be successful in this business, you need to be very educated in your markets. I pride myself on my market knowledge, new and existing tenants looking in the market, as well as staying in contact with landlords and developers to learn of new projects or upcoming available space.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p After moving here to attend and graduate from OSU, I went to work in NYC for two years.  Although the experience was wonderful and I felt like I learned a great deal, I dreamed of moving back to Columbus. The job opportunities, friendships and general feel of the city in 1996, was that the city was on the cusp of really becoming a vibrant and important location that was moving into the 21st century. Since returning, my thoughts have been justified with the incredible growth of the suburbs and now downtown area. I cannot wait to see what the next 20 years have in store.
								h5 What is a favorite pastime you enjoy?
								p My pastimes have become following my children in their academic and athletic pursuits. Club sports has taken us all over the Midwest, east coast and as far away as Seattle. Watching them play at the top level for their age groups has been an incredible experience for me as a parent.
