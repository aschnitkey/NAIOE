								h5.testimonial-bio-company Farber Specialty Vehicles
								p.testimonial-bio-quote It has been a pleasure working with Ohio Equities and the Sheeran family.  Over the past 20 + years we have worked on multiple projects related to real estate sales and leasing. The Ohio Equities team can address and handle everything from the big picture to the details.
								p.testimonial-bio-source Ken Farber, President
								h5.testimonial-bio-company FunBev Distributing
								p.testimonial-bio-quote NAI Ohio Equities has gone above and beyond to assist our business in finding the right space for us. We were in a time crunch to move facilities and there were many late nights and weekend days that were given up to help us find a warehouse space quickly. Dan Sheeran [Jr.] was a pleasure to work with and made everything happen we asked for and always got back to us in a timely manor. NAI Ohio Equities is exemplary and we couldn't have asked for a better experience or business relationship. We will undoubtedly use NAI Ohio Equities in the future.
								p.testimonial-bio-source Mindy Hammond
								h5.testimonial-bio-company SC Wash and Tan
								p.testimonial-bio-quote I couldn't be more satisfied with the professionalism and dedication of the Sheeran Semon Team with our portfolio of properties. They have helped tremendously with our sales and acquisitions, and I couldn't think of a more solid team to work with. You can't go wrong with this group.

								h5.testimonial-bio-company Bandago

								h5.testimonial-bio-company Superior Metal Worx
								p.testimonial-bio-quote The experience with your team, and sales department was superb and went beyond our expectations. We all truly appreciated the respects you gave in our decisions, our time frame, and our requests as a company. As well as your kind, polite natures. At no point did we feel pressured, or pushed into this decision, which made the whole event even easier for us all.

								h5.testimonial-bio-company Amerilimo Coach Sales
								p.testimonial-bio-quote The team of professionals at NAI Ohio Equities have been excellent at connecting us with great tenants for our business investment in Columbus, as well as matching us up with our property purchase many years ago.
								p.testimonial-bio-source Robert Mazzarella
								h5.testimonial-bio-company Midwest Medical Transport Company
								p.testimonial-bio-quote I cannot say enough about Dan Jr and how he worked to find my company a fantastic building in a fantastic location. We have very specific needs in our industry, and Dan was very attentive to those needs. Columbus is a very challenging market to find commercial properties in, but Dan found several viable options for me to look at. In the end, we leased a building that will suit our needs for years to come! During the lease negotiation process, Dan made sure that the lease protected our interests, while not leaving the owners vulnerable, and vice versa. He was also able to negotiate price that was very fair to us during this process as well. Opening a new business in Columbus is very challenging, but my experience with Dan and the rest of his team at NAI was the least challenging portion of getting Midwest Medical Transport Company up and running in Columbus. Thank you Dan Jr, Dan Sr and the rest of the NAI team!
