								p Clients who work with Matt benefit from the global resources of NAI with the personal touch of a small team. What sets Matt apart is his dedication to client communication. He starts with clearly understanding client needs and then develops a comprehensive plan of action and timeline. Throughout the entire process, Matt keeps clients informed and educated. The final result is that his clients feel confident in making highly informed decisions about their real estate opportunities.

								hr
								h5 What do you like most about Commercial Real Estate?
								p I enjoy working with businesses across many different industries and learning how each one operates. It allows us to keep our finger on the pulse of the local and national economy as well as stay on top of the latest trends and what drives commerce. Many of the most interesting conversations we have on a day-to-day basis with our clients center around what makes their businesses successful. Our clients in turn benefit from our experiences of helping similar businesses achieve their real estate goals.
								h5 What separates us from our competition?
								p We are Creative, Responsive and Experienced (CRE). Not only do we strive to be the best communicators in the industry, but we also think outside the box in order to get the job done. We return every phone call promptly, and treat every client and prospect with the same attention and respect. We have a vast amount of experience that allows us to go into every situation prepared, and in turn provide our clients with all the facts necessary to make an informed decision.
								h5 Describe a memorable transaction:
								p When we were helping Cameron Mitchell Restaurants relocate their office headquarters, we had a unique situation arise during one of our tours. It was a cold morning in early December and it was raining outside. We were halfway through the tour and we pulled up to our next stop which was at a construction site in the Arena District. Upon looking at the 100 foot walk we would have to embark on through the mud, our client told us they would rather skip the stop and move on to the next one. We explained to them that not only would that leave us with a big time gap before our next stop, but we were confident this stop was well worth the inconvenience. By the end of the hard hat tour, they had their sights set on what would ultimately become the property they would move into nine months later. Had we skipped that stop that morning, I don’t know if it would have remained in the mix. The lesson we learned that day was to always trust your instincts and leave no stone unturned.
								h5 What is your favorite neighborhood/area of Columbus/Central Ohio?
								p Shortly after we graduated from Ohio State, my wife and I realized we had a strong connection with the Worthington area. We have called this area home for much of our two decades living in Central Ohio. I think our main attraction to Worthington is due to its historic feeling, walkable amenities and centralized location, both downtown and the other northern submarkets. Over the years I have planted deep roots within the community by joining several organizations including the Worthington AM Rotary, the Old Worthington Partnership, the Worthington Community Improvement Corporation and serving as Athletic Director at St Michael School.

								h5.testimonial-bio-company Volunteers of America Ohio & Indiana 
								p.testimonial-bio-quote "I was extremely impressed with the Office Brokerage Team at NAI Ohio Equities and engagement lead Matt Gregory at every turn. The team's passion and strategic expertise and commitment to client service was best-in-class. Whether it was anticipating questions before we asked and offering continuums of solutions along with their recommendations based on their vast experience, or performing financial and risk analyses that supported our decision making or something as simple as making document gathering for marketing purposes painless, the team exceeded our expectations, There is also something refreshing to be said about 24-7 availability and the immediacy of response the team provides through a single point of contact that leverages the expertise of the rest of the team. Matt took what can be a complicated and convoluted process and communicated each milestone of the journey in a digestible way for our team and our board. I would highly recommend Sandy Simpson and Matt Gregory to anyone without reservation as they are committed to relationship building with integrity for the long-term and not just completing a transaction."
