								p With more than 20 years of commercial real estate experience, Matt Gregory has established himself as a future industry leader and one of the most prominent brokers in Central Ohio. Matt has had great success with all real estate property types but specializes in office sales, investments, and leasing. He has completed more than 1,200 transactions over the course of his career and has represented some of Central Ohio’s most premier developments and organizations.
								p During his senior year of college, Matt joined NAI Ohio Equities as a marketing intern, which evolved into a full-time position as Director of Information Technology. In that role, Matt helped the firm establish its digital marketing presence. In 2006, Matt became a licensed agent and in 2009, he co-founded the Office Brokerage Group – one of the top producing office teams in the region – where he has served as Senior Vice President for more than a decade. 
								p Now, as Executive Managing Director, Matt is responsible for developing the NAI Ohio Equities brokerage division’s growth and operational strategies which includes a focus on the recruitment, development, and retention of new associates. He recently announced the launch of the NAI Ohio Equities Fast Track training program for new associates and coaches the firm’s inaugural class. Matt remains the main point of contact for key relationships, and actively helps the firm’s agents navigate new business and negotiations. He is also a member of both the Strategic Planning and Community Engagement committees for the firm.
								p Clients who work with Matt benefit from the global resources of NAI with the personal touch of a small team. What sets Matt apart is his dedication to client communication. He starts with clearly understanding client needs and then develops a comprehensive plan of action and timeline. Throughout the entire process, Matt keeps clients informed and educated. The final result is that his clients feel confident in making highly informed decisions about their real estate opportunities.
								p Matt has been consistently recognized as a CoStar Power Broker and Central Ohio Commercial Information Exchange (COCIE) Top Producer. He has been named a Top 10 Under 40 recipient by Columbus Realtors and has served as the President of Columbus Commercial Industrial Investment Realtors (CCIIR). He previously chaired the Commercial Advisory Board at Columbus Realtors and served as past president of Building Worthington’s Future. He is a former adjunct professor at Columbus State and a regular speaker on real estate panels. Matt is also one of just 15 agents in Columbus that holds both a SIOR and CCIM designation.
								p Matt graduated from The Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Art degree in Communication. He is active in the Worthington community, regularly volunteering his time to civic organizations, non-profits, and economic development committees. In addition to representing several non-profits with their real estate needs, Matt champions their philanthropic efforts both personally and professionally.

								h5 What do you like most about Commercial Real Estate?
								p I enjoy working with businesses across many different industries and learning how each one operates. It allows us to keep our finger on the pulse of the local and national economy as well as stay on top of the latest trends and what drives commerce. Many of the most interesting conversations we have on a day-to-day basis with our clients center around what makes their businesses successful. Our clients in turn benefit from our experiences of helping similar businesses achieve their real estate goals.
								h5 What separates us from our competition?
								p We are Creative, Responsive and Experienced (CRE). Not only do we strive to be the best communicators in the industry, but we also think outside the box in order to get the job done. We return every phone call promptly, and treat every client and prospect with the same attention and respect. We have a vast amount of experience that allows us to go into every situation prepared, and in turn provide our clients with all the facts necessary to make an informed decision.
								h5 Describe a memorable transaction:
								p When we were helping Cameron Mitchell Restaurants relocate their office headquarters, we had a unique situation arise during one of our tours. It was a cold morning in early December and it was raining outside. We were halfway through the tour and we pulled up to our next stop which was at a construction site in the Arena District. Upon looking at the 100 foot walk we would have to embark on through the mud, our client told us they would rather skip the stop and move on to the next one. We explained to them that not only would that leave us with a big time gap before our next stop, but we were confident this stop was well worth the inconvenience. By the end of the hard hat tour, they had their sights set on what would ultimately become the property they would move into nine months later. Had we skipped that stop that morning, I don’t know if it would have remained in the mix. The lesson we learned that day was to always trust your instincts and leave no stone unturned.
								h5 What is your favorite neighborhood/area of Columbus/Central Ohio?
								p Shortly after we graduated from Ohio State, my wife and I realized we had a strong connection with the Worthington area. We have called this area home for much of our two decades living in Central Ohio. I think our main attraction to Worthington is due to its historic feeling, walkable amenities and centralized location, both downtown and the other northern submarkets. Over the years I have planted deep roots within the community by joining several organizations including the Worthington AM Rotary, the Old Worthington Partnership, the Worthington Community Improvement Corporation and serving as Athletic Director at St Michael School.

								h4 Testimonials
								h5.testimonial-bio-company Volunteers of America Ohio & Indiana 
								p.testimonial-bio-quote "I was extremely impressed with the Office Brokerage Team at NAI Ohio Equities and engagement lead Matt Gregory at every turn. The team's passion and strategic expertise and commitment to client service was best-in-class. Whether it was anticipating questions before we asked and offering continuums of solutions along with their recommendations based on their vast experience, or performing financial and risk analyses that supported our decision making or something as simple as making document gathering for marketing purposes painless, the team exceeded our expectations, There is also something refreshing to be said about 24-7 availability and the immediacy of response the team provides through a single point of contact that leverages the expertise of the rest of the team. Matt took what can be a complicated and convoluted process and communicated each milestone of the journey in a digestible way for our team and our board. I would highly recommend Sandy Simpson and Matt Gregory to anyone without reservation as they are committed to relationship building with integrity for the long-term and not just completing a transaction."
