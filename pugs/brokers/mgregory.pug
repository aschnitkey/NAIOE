								hr
								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p I always tell people who ask this question that commercial real estate is a career that actually chooses you and is usually second calling. My story follows such path. I initially started as a marketing technology intern for Ohio Equities which lead to a full time position as Director of Information Technology. While in this position, I was often told that I had a knack for sales so it was only natural that the firm would eventually transition me into a licensed agent. Growing up, I always wanted to work in a diverse industry which is the epitome of what commercial real estate has to offer.
								h5 What is your favorite neighborhood/area of Columbus/Central Ohio?
								p Early in our travels, my wife and I realized we had a strong connection with the Worthington area. We have called this area home for much of our two decades living in Central Ohio. I think our main attraction to Worthington is because of its historic feeling, walkable amenities and central location both downtown and the other northern submarkets.
								h5 What is a favorite pastime you enjoy?
								p My family and I enjoy visiting professional sporting venues and often stop at one in every city in which we travel. Thus far we have been to 24 of the 30 major league baseball stadiums and try to see at least one new stadium every year.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p Are there any hidden gems left in Columbus? With a population that has doubled over the past 15 years to nearly two million people I think nearly every place has been discovered. I used to be able to stay up on all the new openings but now I rely on my clients and co-workers to provide recommendations of all the trendy places to try out.
