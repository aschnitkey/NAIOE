								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p It was always a dream to combine my thirty years of experience in commercial insurance with commercial real estate. Both fields utilize the same buyers and many of the same service needs. I was lucky enough to be able to join my dad, Dan Sheeran Sr. here at Ohio Equities to start a second career.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p I was born here and always considered Columbus home. Having not lived here since 1987, I will be looking for the right part of town for me later this year to call home.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p My son Matthew and I have been lucky enough to take many cruises since he was 10. Ski trips to the east coast are also a favorite. Matthew and I joined my parents on cruises to Alaska and Bermuda as well as trips to The Masters and The Sugar Bowl.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p Rubinos Pizza in Bexley, hands down. (now itâ€™s not so hidden though)
