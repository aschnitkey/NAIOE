						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					p.news-date October 15, 2019
					p In today’s business climate, office design has never played a more important role in the success of a business than it does now. As each year passes, more and new technologies are added and new trends are adopted all around the world, which can make it difficult to keep up. However, it also leads to new and exciting opportunities and experimentation for office design each year, and 2020 looks to be no exception. Expect to see trends that exploit office optimization as we move forward into 2020 — and beyond.
					p Here are some of the trends we predict to see in office spaces in 2020:
					p: strong Office spaces are driven by experience
					p This trend is nothing new in industries where the customer or guest experiences are crucial to success, such as retail or hospitality. However, we predict that you’ll start to see this trend spilling over into other industries in 2020, as consumers’ thirst for unique experiences carries over into Corporate America and beyond.
					p These on-site amenities and features typically reflect the company and its people, rather than taking a “one size fits all” approach. Some of our favorite examples include massage therapy spaces, yoga studios, walking trails, live music spaces, and espresso or cocktail bars.

					p.news-date September 24, 2019
					p 2019 has been a busy year for the medical industry. As CRE continues to evolve, the medical office space is also going through its own transformation.
					p In efforts to enhance availability and boost efficiency, the healthcare sector is transitioning into a new area of the commercial scene. Contemporary tenants, landlords, and developers are all racing to keep up with today’s changing consumer needs; and as a result, the medical office space is being revamped.
					p Let’s take a look at where the medical office market is today, and what trends to look out for during 2019’s third quarter.
					p: strong Energy Efficient Buildings
					p It’s no secret that medical buildings are huge consumers of energy. Due to the sprawling size of the properties, intense lighting needs, air and temperature control, and high-powered machinery; medical office spaces have traditionally been lacking in eco-efficiency.
