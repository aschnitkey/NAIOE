						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					p.news-date March 5, 2019
					p As robots continue to establish a presence on the warehouse floor, this will significantly impact how these warehouses are both designed and built. More automation via robots will require economies of scale, which will impact the demand for warehouse space. Here is how robots are impacting the industrial warehouse market.
					strong Warehouses Will Scale Down
					p Space within warehouses will need to be utilized more intensively, which will result in the warehouses becoming smaller. As robots continue to join the warehouse floor, there will be less human counterparts, requiring less horizontal space and more vertical space since robots can easily navigate around multi-mezzanine levels.

					p.news-date February 14, 2019
					p Amazon sent shockwaves throughout America and abroad when news broke of the e-commerce giant’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The $13.4 billion deal was the first of its kind and showed a leap of faith in from traditional shopping trends to a new, technologically advanced horizon.

					p With the implementation of these new digital grocery options, Amazon has given its Prime members, all 100 million of them, access to new more convenient options. Though upon the inception of this virtual grocery idea, consumers were hesitant to purchase perishable items such as dairy, meats, and vegetables, the number of these items being bought is steadily rising.

					p There are so many important factors that should be considered when searching for warehouse space. Your business will have unique warehousing needs and it can sometimes be daunting to sift through all the industrial lingo and sales pitches just to find the right space for your business. Here are five things you should consider when selecting a warehouse.
					p: strong How Old is the Warehouse?
					p The secret to a quality warehouse is finding one that balances both old and new features. The ideal warehouse space will have weathered a good amount of time to showcase its stability but is also implementing new technology to make processes flow more efficiently. You want to avoid warehouses that are too old where the building can be deemed an antiquated relic and not too new where there are still working issues that need to be smoothed out.
