						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					p Industrial vacancy increased to 7.5% with a positive absorptionof 3.3 million SF in 2020.
					p Amazon accounts for 20% of all leasing activity in Columbus for 2020. The company signed a leased in August for 1.1 million SF a phase I of The Hub development at London Groveport which delivered in September. Amazon signed another lease in September, with plans to occupy a 1.2-million-SF speculative property delivered in the Licking County Submarket in June.
					p Rates continue to rise, however, Columbus is an affordable industrial market, with rents averaging $5.30/SF – around 40% below the national average.
					p Sale price per SF continues to rise and cap rates continue to fall. After a slow start in the first quarter, sales volume made a strong showing in the first half of 2020 thanks to an active second quarter.
					p Developers remain aggresive for land sites.

					p.news-date December 10, 2020
					p Commercial real estate trends are always adapting. The best-selling features of today aren’t always the same ones we’ll see tomorrow. In this business, keeping up with the latest requires due diligence into the market’s hottest items. The ebbs and flows of tenant demands make it imperative for CRE pros to stay abreast of what’s selling and what’s not.
					p Right now, a new trend is emerging on the radar of real estate development. No, it’s not a new technology or lifestyle toy – it’s space. Space has always been a popular amenity for real estate at large, but this comeback is putting a contemporary spin on the trend. Today’s resurgence of space-loving shoppers deserves a second glance.
					p Let’s dive into the market’s preferential treatment towards spacious properties:
					strong Space Considerations in the Time of COVID
					p 2020 has caused many people to reconsider their previously solidified perspective on lifestyle choices. In the past, urban living was at the forefront of most people’s home-hunting lists. People wanted to live in a place with great amenities, connection to the local scene, and strong networks for work and play.

					p.news-date November 17, 2020
					p Commercial real estate’s industrial sector is constantly moving and shaking – and right now, there is too much activity in the warehousing scene to ignore.
					p Namely, there are a few big players in the industry that deserve your attention. The warehousing arena is seeing massive expansion – but, these acquisitions aren’t generated from a myriad of players. Instead, it’s just a few rapidly-expanding tenants who’ve all got their eyes on the prize.
					p While they continue to absorb industrial space, make sure you know whos-who in today’s warehousing landscape. These are the most robust industrial tenants – some of which you’ll be guessing, and others that will be surprising. Let’s dive in:
					strong Amazon
					p Coming in first on our list is, predictably, Amazon. This retail giant is famous for upending competitors and making magnanimous bounds that push the boundaries of modern industry. Right now, the online retailer’s appetite for warehouse assets is insatiable.

					p.news-date October 22, 2020
					p At the introduction of the pandemic, there was much talk circulating the industry regarding the medical space.
					p This was a natural response to a health-centric global crisis, and as all eyes fell on CRE’s medical sector, it was still a time of great uncertainty. During the early months of COVID when nobody knew how intense the stakes may get or how long it all would last, medical office tenants were planning to expand their ground presence while simultaneously flexing their digital capacities.
					p But, it’s been months, and the conversation has veered towards other sectors as new trends unfolded and the situation evolved. But, now that we’re on the cusp of national recovery, it’s a good time to revisit the topic.
					p How’s the medical office space doing right now? At this point, experts are reporting that there’s been a cooldown in the previously laid plans for medical office expansion.
					p Let’s take a look at what data is emerging from the medical space and also at what commercial real estate professionals should be keeping their eye on:
