						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					h1 Market Reports
					p Activity in the Columbus Office Market has just about stabilized thus far in 2022, after recovering from nearly 1,700,000 SF coming on the market during the pandemic. Pent-up demand is playing a large role as tenants re-enter the market after postponing decisions for the last 24 months. Rent growth remains strong throughout the suburbs, especially in Class A and new construction.
					p Direct vacancy rate is up slightly to 9.6% this quarter due in part to construction deliveries. Absorption was slightly negative at nearly 20,000 SF during the second quarter, but the outlook for Q3 22 is strong. The sublease rate continues to drop as space is leased or hits natural expiration.
					p Rents continue to climb and are up 1.1% year over year, a trend which will only continue in upcoming quarters.
					p: em "Despite the national headlines, Columbus remains a strong office market, especially in the Class A and new construction sector. Home grown technology and bio-medical firms are leading the way, along with financial services and all suppliers supporting the Intel expansion in New Albany." - Matt Gregory, VP Office Brokerage

					p This summer, we are preparing to help kids get back to school with full backpacks by supporting Operation Backpack through 
						a.red(href="https://www.voaohin.org/operationbackpack") Volunteers of America Ohio and Indiana.
					p Nearly one in five children in the U.S. live below the federally defined poverty line and their families, who are balancing basic expenses such as utilities and rent or mortgages, too often, have nothing left over.
					p Through the month of July, we will be collecting supplies and monetary donations. But more than that, we are giving children hope, by providing an equal opportunity and confidence as they begin the new school year.
					p If you would like to give hope to a child in need, you can donate by dropping supplies off at our 
						a.red(href="https://www.ohioequities.com") office 
						| or order supplies here and have them shipped directly to us! If you’d like to make a monetary donation, we accept Venmo and donations can be sent to our Marketing Director, Amy Karnes at Amy-Karnes. Our goal is to fill 50 backpacks; each full backpack costs approximately $50.

					h3: a(href="https://www.ohioequities.com/wp/commercialrealestate101/do-you-need-a-specialist-in-commercial-real-estate/") Do You Need a Specialist in Commercial Real Estate?
					p From financial advisors to medical practitioners, at some point, we’ve all needed a specialist. Real estate is no different. We’re all familiar with residential and commercial real estate, but through the years, commercial real estate specifically has become highly specialized.
					p A broker’s role has morphed into that of a real estate “advisor.” Depending on the property type and specialization, there are a slew of functions brokers perform, including financial and market analyses, demographic studies, site selection research, portfolio analysis, and more.
					p The depth of broker specialization is largely dependent on the needs of the market. The larger the market, the more specialized it tends to become. In Columbus, most brokers who are specialists do so by product type: industrial, investments and multifamily, office, and retail, primarily, explains Matt Gregory who specializes in office sales and leasing at NAI Ohio Equities.
					p However, in larger cities, such as New York City, you may encounter brokers that strictly do tenant representation or work within a particular submarket of the city. As Columbus continues to grow, we are also beginning to see the emergence of subspecialization. For example, areas such as medical office, self-storage, data centers, hospitality, religious institutions, and schools, are all types of subspecialties.

					h3: a(href="https://www.ohioequities.com/wp/commercialrealestate101/five-reasons-you-should-hire-a-tenant-rep-to-negotiate-your-commercial-lease/") Five Reasons You Should Hire a Tenant Rep to Negotiate Your Commercial Lease
					p Leases dominated our roster of closed transactions for May with our office signing or renewing leases equating to more than 205,000 square feet.
					p With such a significant amount of leasing activity, we thought we take a deep dive into the benefits and misconceptions regarding tenant representation and share with you our top five reasons why hiring a tenant representative is beneficial!
					p Signing a lease for a commercial property is a big commitment, and finding that perfect space is often a time-consuming and sometimes, daunting task. The good news is - you don’t have to do it alone! Hiring a tenant representative can save you time and money, and provide you with many other benefits you may have not even considered!
					strong Are You Tired of Unreturned Calls?
					p Believe it or not, a lack of representation can affect landlord and broker responsiveness. As brokers and landlords sift through dozens of calls per day, they naturally consider inquiries by other brokers to have more legitimacy. Additionally, they have established relationships with other brokers and landlords, as they have probably worked with them in the past, which also carries weight. And at the end of the day, their goal is to lease their available space, so the effort is placed on returning calls that have the most promising return on investment.
