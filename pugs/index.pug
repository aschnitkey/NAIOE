						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					h1 Market Reports
					h4 Office Overview
					p Columbus office vacancy sits at 10.2% compared to the national average of 13.7% and rent growth remains solid, with Columbus seeing annual gains of 2.3% compared to the national benchmark of 0.7%. Office footprints have shrunk to 3,600 square feet, 10% less than pre-pandemic levels.
					p Rent growth is at 2.3%; a byproduct of large Tenant Improvement (TI) packages and abated rent concessions to keep rates from dropping.
					p TI packages have become equally or more important than rental rate; suggesting rent growth will continue.
					p Medical office leasing remains steady in Class A MOBs.
					p Medical office continues to attract investment and maintaining stronger cap rates in the 6-7.5% range versus the 9-10.5% range in general office.
					p.red -------------------------
					p: em “'Can this suite be demised?’ This is a common question when the average tenant in today’s market only needs 3,600 square feet. Landlords are all competing to win the “small deals”; most are shorter term but still require hefty TI packages. Landlords are signing these deals, less for a large profit today, but rather banking on the traditionally much lower cost lease renewal. These smaller leases all add up and chip away at vacancy. They come with ancillary benefits such as rent roll diversification and greater expansion opportunities throughout the occupancy lifecycle.” -

					p.news-date March 14, 2024
					p A nearly 200-year-old manufacturing campus in Knox County is once again coming to life five years after the announcement that one of the area’s largest employers, Siemens Energy, would cease operations there.
					p The 47-acre property which includes 12 buildings totaling 670,000 square feet was acquired by the Knox County Land Reutilization Corporation, also known as the Knox County Land Bank, in 2020 after Siemens decided it no longer wanted to retain the property following the closure.
					p The property has housed power generation systems manufacturers, from steam engines to jet engines to generators, since 1833. The majority of that time, by the successors of the original occupant, the CE Cooper Co.
					p The campus, now named Heartland Commerce Park, represents the largest collection of available industrial space within the city, explained Jeff Gottke, president of the Knox County Area Development Foundation and the Knox County Land Bank.
					p “It’s a homegrown property that the community feels a lot of connection to. Thousands of current Knox County residents have worked on that property or know someone who did,” he said.

					p.news-date February 27, 2024
					p If you’ve been using the same vendor for years without bidding out the service contract, you could be doing yourself a disservice. As a property management company, bidding out service contracts for our clients is a valuable tool that creates a balance between maintaining quality service and optimizing costs. In this blog post, we delve into the benefits of bidding out service contracts, including which services to start with and the frequency.
					h4 REASONS FOR PERIODICALLY BIDDING OUT SERVICE CONTRACTS
					strong Cost Savings
					p Regularly bidding out service contracts ensures you receive the most competitive pricing from vendors, often resulting in lower costs and better terms. Commercial Property Manager Mary Brown says when soliciting bids, it’s important to use companies that have been vetted, meaning you are familiar with the quality of their service and have already established that their pricing is fair. Unfamiliar companies that have not been vetted may not have the appropriate scope for the property and may submit the lowest bid to earn the business but may not be able to offer comparable quality.
					strong Ensuring Quality Service
					p Periodic bidding, even if you are happy with the service you have, offers a chance to assess quality and offerings from both your current vendor and potential vendors. This process ensures you have thoroughly considered your vendor’s performance and allows you to seek references and evaluate proposals to compare services. This can result in enhanced tenant satisfaction and in some instances, increased property value.

					p.news-date January 30, 2024
					p The $1.78 billion verdict in October against the National Association of REALTORS® has sent shockwaves across the residential real estate industry. The ruling in the case of Sitzer/Burnett v. The National Association of Realtors et al, including Compass Inc., EXP World Holdings Inc., Redfin Corp., Weichert Realtors, United Real Estate, Howard Hanna Real Estate Services, and Douglas Elliman Inc., claimed that the NARs “participation rule” and “cooperative compensation” practices forced home sellers to pay inflated commissions to buyer agents. Within hours of the verdict, the plaintiff attorneys in the case filed a separate class-action lawsuit against another set of companies with the same allegations.
					p Anywhere Real Estate Inc., the parent company of Coldwell Banker, also agreed in early October to pay $83.5 million to settle a pair of class-action lawsuits and to overhaul its policies toward commissions. RE/MAX Holdings Inc. has separately agreed to pay $55 million. Since then, the residential real estate world has been reeling as brokerages navigate the appeals process and reformation of their existing commission practices.
					p Many have asked us if and how these rulings will affect commercial compensation practices and what impact these rulings will have overall. To answer this question, it is important to understand the different views and practices in the residential and commercial industries which we believe, in part, influenced this decision and its outcomes.
					strong Multiple Listing Services
					p Multiple Listing Services or “MLS”, were created as a way to share information about listings for residential real estate. They serve as a single source of listing information for a market, and that information is easily accessible to the consumer.
