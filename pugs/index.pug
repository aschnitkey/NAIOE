						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					h1 Market Reports
					p The industrial market seems to have normalized back to pre-pandemic days in recent months. The vacancy rate continues to increase and is expected to do so through Q4 2023. Central Ohio is emerging as a top tier market for data centers with Microsoft, Google and Amazon planning or building new facilities.
					p Lease rates have been increasing despite the rise in the vacancy rate. Expect rate increases to continue as the current spec projects under construction get absorbed.
					p Development of future speculative warehouse space has slowed significantly with only 1.6 MSF of new construction starts in Q2 2023, which is down significantly from the same quarter last year.
					p The amount of space available for sublease has increased significantly to 2.5 MSF, but at less than one percent of the overall market it is not having a big impact on lease rates.
					p With the Intel and the Honda/LG EV battery facilities under construction, expect to start seeing a positive impact with their suppliers coming into the area.
					p: em “Central Ohio is one of the few metro areas in the Midwest that is growing. It continues to be a place companies want to do business. Due to its proximity to a large percentage of the U.S and Canadian populations it will always be a strong logistics hub. Now with it being identified as a near perfect location for data centers the area’s growth will get stronger and continue into the foreseeable future” - Curt Berlin, SIOR, Industrial Specialist

					p.news-date August 24, 2023 
					p Your offer has been accepted, you’ve completed your due diligence, and you’re closing on your commercial property – so, what’s next? Whether you are a commercial property owner or tenant, there are still more details to attend to. From preparing your space for occupancy to budgeting for long-term capital expenses, these are the must-do’s now that you’re closing.
					strong 1. PREPARE THE SPACE FOR OCCUPANCY
					p Now that you’ve found the perfect space for your business, or secured the ideal tenant, it’s time to begin making it your own. You’ll need to retain a qualified architect and designer to create a functional and visually appealing layout and to obtain the proper permits. You’ll also set up your utilities and possible infrastructure needed such as internet connectivity, and make sure to update your address with vendors, and on your website and business cards, etc. Also, make a plan for the financial organization of your property by establishing which bank accounts you will use for bills, and think about hiring a CPA advisor to help you navigate taxes and other financial matters. It’s also a good idea to introduce yourself to your neighbors, and local fire and police departments, and consider joining the local chamber of commerce. Lastly, it’s time to think about building security, such as lighting, security guards or access control, surveillance, and alarm systems.

					p.news-date July 26, 2023
					p The role of the commercial property manager has evolved. Office vacancy rates continue to remain high due to work-from-home and hybrid policies and tenants are seizing the opportunity to upgrade their space. The flight to quality – a migration to amenity-driven spaces in walkable mixed-use communities, has posed a dilemma for building owners, property managers, and brokers, with a surplus of aging office space that continues to sit on the market.
					p As a result, property managers are now finding that they have become curators of the “tenant experience” to compete. In addition to ensuring the day-to-day tasks of building maintenance are completed, they are hosting events and creatively incorporating amenities for tenant attraction and retention.
					p NAI Ohio Equities’ property manager 
						strong: a(href="https://ohioequities.com/managers/mbrown.html", target="_blank", rel= "noopener noreferrer", style="color: #AF2D37;") Mary Brown 
						| said she planned her first tenant event eight years ago. At the time the practice was uncommon, but she says it’s an emerging trend that should be embraced.
					p Brown began by planning quarterly events and explained that the concept began as a trial but has now become a tool that she wouldn’t be without, and it has benefited all parties involved.
					p “The building owner has an opportunity to retain tenants, the property management team has the opportunity to get to know the tenants and their needs, and the tenants get to know each other and their businesses,” she explained.
