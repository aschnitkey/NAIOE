						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					h1 Market Reports
					p Threats of a recession may cause retailers to postpone expansion plans in early 2023, but retail vacancy has continued to fall to the lowest point on record, which has been driven by steady demand fueled by wage growth and household savings. Rent growth has also accelerated with peaks expected early in the year.
					p  Rent growth has hastened with rents currently 5.6% higher than this same time last year.
					p As of Q4 22, 824,000 SF of retail space is under construction across 15 submarkets.
					p Retailers, including discount chains which have fared well through the pandemic recovery, are facing challenges due to inflation, which could impact expansion plans.
					p: em "Retail fundamentals continue to be strong in the local retail market, with inflationary pressures dampening expansion in some categories like the restaurant sector. According to a recent National Restaurant Association survey, 40% of restaurant operators are now putting off previous expansion plans with rising costs being the primary cause for pause. This, even as the labor market is giving hints of a revival." - Mike Simpson, President

					p.news-date February 23, 2023
					p Pressures on the energy market have been mounting and soon consumers will be faced with the fallout.
					p The combination of the pandemic causing workplaces to go dark thus lessoning demand and production, followed by labor and supply shortages, a diminished natural gas supply caused by the invasion of Ukraine, and now inflation, have pushed energy markets to the brink.
					p Couple that with the rising value of exported liquified natural gas overseas, which is driving producers to move more of their supply to Europe where the commodity commands pricing nearly five times higher than it does in the United States, and you have a recipe for skyrocketing electricity rates.
					p “Businesses can expect electricity prices to climb by nearly 40% this June,” explained Rob Myers, managing partner at Ohio Industrial Energy.
					p “Roughly 80% of electricity is now generated from natural gas instead of coal, making those markets more correlated than they’ve ever been,” he said.
					p Pricing is based on the wholesale electric market and determined by the utilities during auctions conducted in November and March for the following June.
					p “If the market is volatile during those times, as it was this past November, it can have big consequences. Current rates in Columbus are sitting at roughly 7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the November auction cleared rates at 12 cents per kilowatt-hour,” he explained.

					p.news-date December 15, 2022
					p It’s been an eventful year in commercial real estate as the recovery drove record-level activity, and now, with activity slowing as a result of interest rate increases intended to temper inflation. As we look forward to next year, our market experts share their insights on what you can expect as we head into 2023.
					strong INTEREST RATES
					p Uncertainty around interest rates will continue to affect decision making for the first half of 2023. After reaching record lows of around 3.5%, and then climbing to the highs of about 6.5% during 2022, interest rates will begin to stabilize in 2023 and return to a midway point of about 5%.
					strong CONSTRUCTION COST
					p In general, labor and materials for construction projects will be more difficult to obtain. Rising costs will limit new construction in the retail sector, and in the office market, rising construction costs will cause rates to increase as landlords cover tenant improvements.
					strong SPECULATIVE DEVELOPMENT
					p In the industrial market, expect far fewer speculative warehouse construction starts this coming year. In the office market, speculative development will continue to be limited, with the exception of some office within mixed-use developments.
