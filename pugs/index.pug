						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					h1 Market Reports
					p With vacancy rates of 3.9% sitting well below the national average of almost 5% due to nearly 752,000 SF absorbed in the past 12 months, and rents being the highest in the state, Columbus’ retail sector is showing strength.
					p Rents in Columbus lead the state at about $17 per square foot - about 20% higher than Cleveland or Cincinnati.
					p Columbus rents are 1.6% higher than this same time last year.
					p Single tenant net leases dominated the first quarter of 2022.
					p As of Q1 22, more than 940,000 square feet of space is under construction across 14 different submarkets.
					p: em "Retail leasing has rebounded nicely in the Columbus market. Velocity has returned to pre- pandemic levels, with 175,000 SF absorbed through mid-February. Overall, Columbus’ retail fundamentals are strong with low vacancy and good rent growth. New construction starts are the only low point, with just 100,000 SF delivered in the first quarter." - Mike Simpson, President

					p.news-date April 7, 2022
					p Our office gained some serious momentum in March, closing 29 commercial transactions for the month. These transactions included a significant number of medical office buildings (MOBs) so we thought we’d take this opportunity to take a closer look at these notoriously stable assets and ask our experts what they are seeing post-COVID in the sector, and the trends we can expect to see in 2022.
					strong Emphasis on Healthy Buildings
					p It’s no surprise that as we emerge from a pandemic, medical office building trends would include an emphasis on “healthy” buildings. Initiatives such as improved ventilation and air quality, as well as higher standards with regard to cleaning protocols, will be high on the list, explained NAI Ohio Equities President, Mike Simpson and Senior Vice President of Office Brokerage, Matt Gregory.
					strong Lease Rates are Going Up and Tenant Improvement Allowances are Decreasing
					p As with all sectors of commercial real estate, rising construction costs are having an impact on lease rates. Ground-up new construction is starting around $21-$22 per square foot for a triple net lease in Central Ohio, explained Gregory.

					p.news-date March 24, 2022
					p These days, investors are loving the Central Ohio real estate market. Once overlooked, Columbus has emerged as a solid investment choice. Columbus attracts both businesses and talent alike, offering investors opportunities in every market sector.
					p With that said, here are five reasons, why as an investor, you should take a closer look at Columbus!
					strong 1. We Have the Workforce.
					p The Central Ohio region, which consists of eleven counties, has 52 colleges and universities, including The Ohio State University, and produces approximately 22,000 college graduates annually. The region is home to one of the highest concentrations of college students in the United States, many of which remain long after graduation, creating a sustainable and growing pool of 
						a.red(href="https://columbusregion.com/skilled-talent/", target="_blank") talent!
					strong 2. Millennials Live Here.
					p Columbus has one of the highest concentrations of the millennial population in the country, at 25.9%, according to 
						a.red(href="https://money.com/collection-post/best-places-millennials/", target="_blank") Money.com. 
						| Millennials are the 
						a.red(href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/11/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force/", target="_blank") largest generation in the U.S. labor force 
						| and as such, companies need to have access to them. Therefore, a city such as Columbus, with an above average concentration is highly attractive.

					p.news-date February 28, 2022
					p NAI Ohio Equities had a strong February with more than 20 closings this month. Our office sold or leased more than 182,600 square feet, and signed or renewed leases with 15 tenants.
					p Our featured property this month is 895 Parsons Avenue, a 9,700 square foot freestanding building on the city’s south end nestled within the neighborhood of Schumacher Place, which sits adjacent to German Village, Merion Village, Southern Orchards, and is in close proximity to Nationwide Children’s Hospital, the largest pediatric hospital in the United States.
					p The building houses both a laundromat and daycare and will offer close to 2,500 square feet of space for lease. However, its significance lies in what it represents - a community that is taking shape.
					p Because of the area’s proximity to the hospital, which employs roughly 1,100 medical professionals and 14,000 employees, there has been a focus over the past decade on the housing stock in the area and subsequently, its revitalization. In 2014, the Parsons Avenue Redevelopment Corporation (PARC) was formed with the goal of spearheading real estate development initiatives in the area.
