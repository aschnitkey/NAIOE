						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					p.news-date February 11, 2020
					p The Smart revolution is upon us. Smartphones, Smart Devices, Smart Houses, Smart Buildings; the list continues. We’re in a seemingly never-ending progression towards all things Smart – and the development reaches its peak capacity with Smart Cities.
					p These tech-powered metropolitan locations represent the height of contemporary technologies. All things digital come together to create a seamless net of information, innovation, and evolution.
					p In the last year alone, Smart Cities have undergone progress at an inconceivable rate. What was once impossible is now the norm in the globe’s biggest Smart Cities such as New York City, Paris, Tokyo, Reykjavik, Seoul, and London.
					p When change is happening so fast, it’s a good idea for all of us to slow down and catch up. This is especially vital for CRE professionals who need to remain up to speed on the latest commercial real estate developments all over the world.
					p Sit back, relax, and get caught up. Here’s how the Smart City module has changed during 2019:
					strong Advanced 5G Connectivity
					p 5G is here. Although we’re already pretty familiar with this cool new tool, it’s important to remember that 5G wasn’t around a year ago.

					p.news-date January 21, 2020
					p Is it that time of year, again?
					p Office lease renewal periods are a great time to reconsider your current terms as it provides tenants with the opportunity to think about some important points. In any commercial deal, lease renewals should be handled with winning strategies.
					p If you’re ready to renew your office lease, make sure to consider these 4 points first:
					strong Always Read Between the Lines
					p Tenants should never get too comfortable. Carefully reviewing the exact terms of each lease will help office tenants avoid big problems down the line. Even if you’ve been in the same office space for years, don’t think you can skim through the paperwork at renewal time.
					p First things first, the most basic rule should be to get clear on the details. It’s a good idea to assume that each lease is completely different - helping you to pay closer attention.
					p Always look out for rent increases, coverage of operational costs, tax rates, and maintenance. Consider how these slight adjustments will impact the deal as a whole. If something seems unclear, don’t hesitate to request clarification from your landlord.

					p.news-date December 10, 2019
					p We all know that real estate is a prosperous industry. Its profit-boosting powers have been catching the eyes of a new demographic. Can you guess who?
					p If universities came to mind, then you’re right on the ball. Colleges have been heavily investing in their surrounding communities for a while, and they’ve been reaping the rewards. Universities are now playing a far more active role in their local commercial markets.
					p Let’s take a look at how colleges are using commercial real estate to increase their profits.
					strong Expanding the Campus Grounds
					p Today’s colleges aren’t set up the same way they were 30 years ago. The business has changed and universities have evolved into larger and more dynamic campuses.
					p The traditional college setup has expanded to include student housing, top-rated facilities, school buildings, shops, bookstores, cafes, and more. In diversifying their business platform, colleges are expanding their money-generating potentials.
					p Colleges are known to capitalize on CRE spaces like restaurants, multifamily complexes, entertainment options, off-site gyms, and other amenities for their student bodies. Universities are broadening their investment possibilities, fattening their portfolios, and increasing their income.
