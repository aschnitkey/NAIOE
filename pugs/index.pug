						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					p Office net absorption climbed out of the negative in the Third Quarter to a positive absorption of 39,684 SF for the first time this year, primarily due to new construction. An additional 696,000 SF of office space is under construction as of Q3 21.
					p Quoted rental rates averaged $21.18/SF in the Third Quarter, which held steady from the previous quarter.
					p As of August, rents were up 0.7% year over year in Columbus in contrast to the U.S. overall where rents are down 0.8% year over year.
					p Medical office properties also remained attractive in the Third Quarter.
					p Year to date, five properties totaling 235,000 SF have entered the market. The largest is the 130,000 SF office property at 500 Neil Ave., in Downtown’s Arena District. As of Q3 21, 1.2 million SF of space is under construction, representing 1.0% of inventory.
					p: em “Two sectors of the Columbus Office Market are very active in 2021 as companies continue their return to the office: owner/occupant office sales 20k SF and below, and tenant office leasing 10k SF and below. Lucrative financing opportunities, move-in ready space with short-term commitments for evaluating growth and minimal landlord TI requirements are all contributing. Multi-tenant general and medical office investment sales remain strong in key submarkets.” - Andy Dutcher, Senior VP, Office Brokerage

					p.news-date October 18, 2021
					p The rapidly expanding Original BARK Company, announced in a press release last week that it would be creating 500 full-time jobs in Columbus over the next four years, tripling its staff.
					p Launched in 2012, with its monthly, themed subscription, BARK Box, BARK has now expanded to include, BARK Super Chewer, BARK Bright, and BARK Eats.
					p The success of these expansions, and specifically, the success of BARK Eats, drove co-founder, Carly Strife to think about expanding its industrial space here in Columbus, Ohio, which accounts some of the job creation the company announced last week. 
					p Matt Osowski and the Industrial Brokerage Team have helped BARK Eats navigate its warehouse space expansion three times in as many years, beginning with its 5000 sq. ft. space located at 684 New York Ave.
					p However, BARK Eats quickly grew again, and by Spring of 2020 BARK Eats moved into a 15,000 sq. ft. space on 1070 W. Third Street. By December of 2020, Strife reached out once again to Osowski and the Industrial Brokerage Team, this time looking for 100,000 sq. ft. warehouse and a tenant to sublease its existing space.

					p.news-date October 7, 2021
					p September commercial real estate transactions remained steady and accounted for roughly 325,000 sq. ft. in sold or leased, office, investment, industrial, and retail properties in our office.
					p One of our largest sales was 485 Lee Street in Belpre, Ohio. The self-storage facility featured nearly 78,000 sq. ft. of rentable space and an astounding 465 units.
					p Self-storage continues to be a desired investment sector, and has gained significant interest recently for several reasons. To begin, explained Investment Team Broker, Tyler Watkins, self-storage properties tend to be easier to manage and have significantly lower operating costs than traditional multi-family investment properties.
					p "Multi-family properties have tenants who are occupying and using the residence on a daily basis, because of this, there is more maintenance as opposed to storage units, he explained. Consider, for example, a tenant who needs after-hours assistance because they are experiencing a plumbing issue. That’s just not the case with self-storage", he said.
					p Watkins added that another driving force behind this surge is the emergence of software that can automate processes for owners, further reducing operating costs.
