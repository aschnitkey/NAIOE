						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					p.news-date November 26, 2019
					p The clock is ticking for opportunity zone investment. Are you prepared?
					p As 2019 comes to a close, investors will need to play their cards right regarding opportunity zones. The coming months will be vital to the development of the country’s opportunity zone program.
					p Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening with OZs and some tips to help investors stay on their A-Game.
					p: strong Off to a Slow Beginning
					p When 2019 started, investors were taking their time. There was a lot of speculation within the industry as to how opportunity zones would play out in the big picture. The tangible benefits and ROI-boosting powers of opportunity zones weren’t so clear, causing investors to withdrawal until there was a better idea of what’s coming next.
					p For the most part, investors chose to err on the side of caution and wait it out. Playing it safe meant stalling on the big moves, and this resulted in a slowdown in opportunity zone activity. Fundraising projects were slow to grow and many thought that there just wasn’t enough interest around the country’s OZs.

					p.news-date October 29, 2019
					p While there is a huge, growing trend toward being able to work remotely, it comes as no surprise that the majority of businesses today still operate out of some form of commercial space, whether that be a factory, office, or retail storefront (or some combination of these). If you are in the market to launch a new business, or even if you are just thinking of expanding or altering your existing business, one of the first steps you will need to take is in deciding how to finance your commercial real estate.
					p Most often, this choice comes in the form of either renting or purchasing commercial space. When you purchase commercial real estate, you can either buy it outright or finance it with a loan from a bank or other financial institution. When you lease, you simply rent the term for an agreed-upon amount of time; once this time is up, you must renegotiate the lease if you’d like to stay in the property — at the risk of paying more for the same space.
					p Not surprisingly, there are pros and cons to both buying and leasing commercial real estate. Several factors should go into choosing the right acquisition strategy for you and your business, including business equity, tax implications, cash outflows, property value and more. To help you make a more informed decision, let’s dive deeper into some of the pros and cons of buying and leasing commercial real estate.
