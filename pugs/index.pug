						h2 Six Best-Practices All Investors Should Keep Top-of-Mind
						p Are you thinking about venturing into the world of real estate investment? There are plenty of things you should know before making the plunge and signing on the dotted line. If you are just starting out you may be wondering where to even begin, but the good news is, every successful real estate investor wondered the same thing. Here are six best-practices all real estate investors should keep top-of-mind.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Hire a Bookkeeper
								p The first thing you should do is hire a bookkeeper because keeping up with documents and paperwork is a lot less stressful if you do it from the start. The documents will come in handy when tax season rolls around and you can write off your bookkeeper as an expense for your business on your taxes.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Learn How to Find Deals
								p One of the hardest parts about investing in real estate is finding the deals. This is a primary function of the business because it’s really what all of real estate investing comes down to. Without a deal, you can’t invest. If you have not, you need to set up your real estate team and systems to be part of finding the deals. An automated lead machine can help you generate leads at all times of the day so you are never losing out on deal opportunities.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Be Consistent
								p Consistency will always beat out talent, resources or experience. Think of real estate investing as a marathon, not a race. You need to accomplish little goals each day to make it to the finish line of this long process. Be sure to track and measure all of your lead-generating efforts. All you need to do to be successful in this is put in the time and effort needed to accomplish these daily goals.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Document Everything
								p You will be swamped if you don’t document and systemize all of the operations of your business and will thus limit your income and growth as well if you are disorganized. As a self-employed individual, the power and control are solely in your hands. First, you need to document and systemize everything, then you need to delegate tasks to others while maintaining clarity and control over the business. Make sure you stay as involved as possible with the business while utilizing documentation and organizing systems.
						.row
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Buy More &amp; Sell Less
								p Intend to hold every property possible. If you need more cash flow, you may need to flip occasionally, but this is fine because cash pays the bills and keeps the business going. The more properties you hold, the more money you will make in the long run and the quicker you will make the money. Any seasoned real estate investor will tell you to buy more and sell less.
							.col-sm-6
								h3.red Underpromise to Partners
								p When it comes to investing, people know that there are a lot of variables that are in play and that risk comes with the territory, but when things don’t work out as planned, it’s easy to point the finger. Try to avoid by underpromising to your partners, but overdelivering. Do not borrow more money than you can use.

					p Office net absorption climbed out of the negative in the Third Quarter to a positive absorption of 39,684 SF for the first time this year, primarily due to new construction. An additional 696,000 SF of office space is under construction as of Q3 21.
					p Quoted rental rates averaged $21.18/SF in the Third Quarter, which held steady from the previous quarter.
					p As of August, rents were up 0.7% year over year in Columbus in contrast to the U.S. overall where rents are down 0.8% year over year.
					p Medical office properties also remained attractive in the Third Quarter.
					p Year to date, five properties totaling 235,000 SF have entered the market. The largest is the 130,000 SF office property at 500 Neil Ave., in Downtown’s Arena District. As of Q3 21, 1.2 million SF of space is under construction, representing 1.0% of inventory.
					p: em “Two sectors of the Columbus Office Market are very active in 2021 as companies continue their return to the office: owner/occupant office sales 20k SF and below, and tenant office leasing 10k SF and below. Lucrative financing opportunities, move-in ready space with short-term commitments for evaluating growth and minimal landlord TI requirements are all contributing. Multi-tenant general and medical office investment sales remain strong in key submarkets.” - Andy Dutcher, Senior VP, Office Brokerage

					p.news-date December 9, 2021
					p November transactions remained steady for NAI Ohio Equities. Our team closed more than 25 commercial real estate transactions, equating to more than 662,400 square feet. Of the month's transactions, nearly one-third were office space.
					p The conversation about remote work and whether or not to return to the office is continuing as we approach 2022 and round out the second year of the pandemic.
					p Though recent trends such as “The Great Resignation” have fueled the fire with regard to remote work, there are signs that organizations want employees back in the office and that the office market is staging a return.
					p “In Columbus and the surrounding areas, demand is outpacing availability in certain segments of the office market,” explained Matt Gregory, Andy Dutcher and Phillip Bird of the Office Brokerage Group at NAI Ohio Equities.
					p “We are seeing a large demand for spaces under 20,000 square feet for owner-occupant sales and under 10,000 square feet for tenant leasing,” said the Office Brokerage Group.
					p Small to mid-size businesses have been quicker to return to the office than larger organizations, said senior vice president Matt Gregory.

					p.news-date November 23, 2021
					p: strong What is the Difference Between a Broker Opinion of Value and an Appraisal?
					p Both a Broker Opinion of Value (BOV) and an appraisal utilize the same approaches to determining the value of properties, however there are some key differences.
					p To begin, an appraisal is performed by a state-licensed third-party and performed at a cost. Specifically, in terms of commercial real estate, the cost may be significant. Often, a BOV is at little or no cost, as many brokers provide this service as a means of earning the representation for the property. There are specific guidelines stipulating what uses a BOV may or may have.
					p Another key differentiator between a BOV and an appraisal is the detail provided. There are variations in depth of the BOV analysis, but most consider the property condition, size, location, age, tenant data, and a number of other attributes of the physical structure/property. Appraisals tend to include external factors in addition, including area demographics, topography, drainage and soil conditions, and flood and environmental hazards. That is not to say that the analysis of a BOV isn’t comprehensive. Brokers performing these opinions are skilled at market research and analysis. The guidelines, however, for the details necessary to include in an appraisal are more stringent.

					p.news-date November 18, 2021
					p The Columbus Department of Development presented its proposed update to the Community Reinvestment Area Residential Abatement policy as part of a scheduled three-year review, on Wednesday Nov. 17, during a public meeting.
					p The updated proposal affects tax abatements in both the legacy community reinvestment areas, as well as in designated as “Market Ready” and “Ready for Revitalization” areas, which are determined based on the number of qualifying distress criteria.
					p Distress criteria include population growth, median household income growth, poverty rate, growth in median rent, housing vacancy rate and mortgage foreclosure rate.
					p Proposed eligible developments would qualify for a 100% 15-year tax abatement as long as they remain compliant with the requirements for the entirety of the 15 years.
					p The 2018 policy mandated that multi-family housing developers set aside 10% of units for residents earning 80% of the area median income (AMI) and 10% of units for residents earning 100% AMI in order to earn an abatement.
					p The proposed policy would now mandate that developers go “deeper or wider” in providing affordable housing. To achieve this, multi-family developers could “deepen” affordability by offering 10% of units to residents earning 60% of AMI and 10% of units to those earning 80% of AMI, or developers could choose to “widen” the percentage of units being allocated from 10% to 30%, while maintaining that residents earn 80% of AMI.
