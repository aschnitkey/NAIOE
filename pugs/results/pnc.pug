							dt Situation
							dd PNC Plaza located at 155 E Broad Street in downtown Columbus, Ohio was struggling with vacancy during the early 2000s but when accounting firm Deloitte LLP moved out in May of 2010 it left a 45,000 square foot hold over five floors of the 24-story tower.
							dt Challenge
							dd With vacancy rates reaching a high of 39 percent in 2010, the challenge was to attract companies downtown. At the time, similar CBD buildings were closer to 17 percent vacancy. It was clear the lease rate was too high to appeal to new tenants who could go to comparable buildings for less rent or stay outside of the downtown area and benefit from lower rent and more parking.
							dt Solution
							dd The brokerage team of Matt Gregory and Andy Dutcher of NAI Ohio Equities has worked with the Landlord to emphasize the importance of an attractive price point for leasing. The team worked diligently to attract companies to the downtown building with extensive research and marketing to potential tenants who could fill the wide range of available office space.
							dt Results
							dd Through extensive relationship building and tenant prospecting, the team has executed eight new leases, one expansion, and two renewals for a total of 71,841 SF office space leased over the past five years. Most recently, Ohio Health leased 36,297 SF over four floors to accommodate their overflow of employees in the downtown area.
