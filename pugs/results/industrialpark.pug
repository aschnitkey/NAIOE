							dt Project
							dd Once known as an industrial area with inexpensive rent, the Southeast Industrial Park in Central Ohio has turned into a goldmine with desirable industrial buildings for sale on over 33 acres of land.
							dt Approach
							dd When Hackman Capital Partners purchased the 18 buildings less than a mile from the Alum Creek exit off I-70 in 2012, the plan was to sell the entire industrial park to one owner. Before retaining NAI Ohio Equities, Hackman Capital Partners worked with another broker in town. The company sold one property, but ultimately decided it would be better to go with another brokerage. After retaining Curt Berlin, Matt Osowski, Mike Semon, and Dan Sheeran, it was determined the best course of action was to sell the buildings as individual parcels instead of a whole.
							dd During the sales process, current tenants were offeed the opportunity to purchase their building when their leases were expiring. With that offer, 5 of the 17 buildings were sold to occupied tenants.
							dt Results
							dd Within six months, the first building was sold to Crimson Cup for their new innovation lab. After 36 months, 11 of the remaining 17 parcels were also sold, leaving only three currently on the market. Some of the more prominent companies located in the Southeast Industrial Park include Unistrut, Sabo Industries, Appian Manufacturing, and the Yellow Cab Company.

					p "The NAI Ohio Equities Industrial Team has done an excellent job for us. After purchasing Southeast Industrial Park our goal has been to sell the buildings individually. Their team has clearly communicated our objectives to the brokerage community and end users. Through an aggressive marketing effort they have been able to sell 13 of the 18 buildings in the park. We appreciate their determined and honest approach to business."
