						p(style="max-width: 120ch;") For years, Ohio ENT &amp; Allergy Physicians had self-managed its portfolio of buildings. In 2024, the practice decided to engage NAI Ohio Equities to assist with these efforts. 
						p(style="max-width: 120ch;") As the portfolio transitioned to our care, we performed an audit to assess the current state of the buildings, as well as reviewed all service contracts. As we reviewed the contracts, we discovered that the janitorial service contract had not been sent out to bid for nearly 15 years.  anitorial expenses are commonly one of the largest service-related expenses, and so our team  everaged NAI Ohio Equitiesâ€™ trusted network of vetted and qualified vendors and requested quotes for janitorial services. Through this process, Ohio ENT &amp; Allergy Physicians saved more than $100,000 annually while also improving the level of service it received.
