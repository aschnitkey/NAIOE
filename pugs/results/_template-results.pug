							dt Project
							dd Alvis House was looking for a larger complex to house their corporate headquarters and combine multiple offices under one roof. The building needed to be close to public transportation, close to its other locations in Franklin County, and have enough parking for employees and visitors.
							dt Approach
							dd Peter and Matt identified a vacant property that was formerly used as a headquarters and met all of the requirements. After multiple site tours and three months of negotiating, Alvis House went into contract on what they believed would become their future home.
							dd After completing months of due diligence, Alvis House was unable to obtain a variance to accommodate its parking needs. Exhausting every measure, Alvis House decided to redirect its efforts to a new location.
							dd Within a week, Peter and Matt were able to uncover another property located in Columbus that matched the Alvis House's needs. The building, located at 2100 Stella Court, was set to go to auction. After successfully convincing the seller to delay the auction and consider the offer from Alvis House, the building was put into contract.
							dt Results
							dd After all the twists and turns, the 51,089 SF three-story building gave Alvis House plenty of room to house all of their various departments and programs under one roof, as well as giving them an oversized parking lot. The final location ended up being more preferred and a better value.

					p "We have grown significantly in the past few years and had to lease space at three separate locations in order to accomodate the needs of the agency. I was delighted with the personal commitment made by both Peter and Matt to find us a property that met all of Alvis House's needs. The time and effort they have put forth has been invaluable."
