						em "I was extremely impressed with the Office Brokerage Team at NAI Ohio Equities and engagement lead Matt Gregory at every turn. The team's passion and strategic expertise and commitment to client service was best-in-class. Whether it was anticipating questions before we asked and offering continuums of solutions along with their recommendations based on their vast experience, or performing financial and risk analyses that supported our decision making or something as simple as making document gathering for marketing purposes painless, the team exceeded our expectations, There is also something refreshing to be said about 24-7 availability and the immediacy of response the team provides through a single point of contact that leverages the expertise of the rest of the team. Matt took what can be a complicated and convoluted process and communicated each milestone of the journey in a digestible way for our team and our board. I would highly recommend Sandy Simpson and Matt Gregory to anyone without reservation as they are committed to relationship building with integrity for the long-term and not just completing a transaction."

						em "We are a small family-owned company and were given a tight timeline to relocate our Columbus location. Occupancy rates were fairly high at the time, so the search was limited from the start. Joe Menninger of NAI Ohio Equities asked a lot of questions about our business to learn what our needs were, both now and in the future, so we were able to see several properties meeting our criteria in a short period of time. As we expanded our search from leasing only to possible purchase, Joe’s experience really paid off, as we had never been down that road before. He was always available by phone or email to answer questions and guide us through the process, and he provided great referrals for both the financing and our plumbing upgrades once the purchase was complete.

							| Our new property has more square feet than we needed, so we’ve been able to lease out a portion of it as well. Joe has also assisted with that process, and he continues to be a good sounding board as we grow into this building. If &amp; when the time comes to find a new property, I won’t hesitate to contact Joe again and utilize his knowledge, experience, and professionalism."

						em "The 580 South High Company hired Andy and Matt to list and promote our 60,000 square foot office building in the central business district of Columbus about 18 months ago. The building’s ownership believes that we have had the opportunity to see most every qualified prospect that has come through the market that matches our availability. Prior to hiring Andy and Matt, our building had minimal leasing activity. With their expertise, we developed a re-branding of the property, new marketing materials and the ability to attract quality brokers representing good credit tenants. Since they have partnered with us, we have signed a handful of new leases and have prospects lined up to lease our remaining vacancies.

						em Our requirements as a small company with multiple requirements made it challenging to find the right space for the right price and John spent the time to find the perfect building with an available 13,600sf, seven docks, and a well negotiated rate. He asked all the right questions to ensure our space is future-proof and scale-able for our rapidly expanding US business.

						em He has also been very supportive in establishing points of contact with local resources that touch multiple facets of our business - both with the US/Canada Business Association and Columbus 2020. Both organizations have proven to be valuable assets in my growing network. These contacts have helped to establish our foundation in the US and facilitate growth of our US operations."

						em "In the beginning of 2016, our law firm began touring the Columbus/Worthington office market on our own. We met Andy when he was the leasing agent at Northwoods II, and despite some negative comments we heard from other tenants in the building at that time, Andy made us feel comfortable and confident a deal could be made given the lease up plan that was in place from Wells Fargo. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo decided to put the property up for auction, and we had to explore other opportunities. At that point, we had several discussions with Andy, and our firm retained Andy as our tenant representative because he was honest with us throughout the entire Northwoods II process and he proved to be an expert in understanding the Columbus office market and what it takes for a tenant to make an informed decision. Ultimately, Andy helped us successfully negotiate a long term renewal at our current office building that will serve our needs for the next decade. Our firm would highly recommend his services to any tenant or landlord."

Matt really came through, everything we needed in a space he found, in numerous locations! I cannot imagine anyone could have made the process easier for us, he has a great sense of humor & guided us through the whole process in a way that didn't disrupt the business we were already tending to, which was amazing. We would recommend Matt to anyone who ever needs to find the business space of their dreams. I can't possibly thank him enough or say enough great things about him!"

						em "Finding a commercial space for the birth and growth of our company seemed like daunting task. Being a small start-up company with a limited budget had deterred people from helping us in the past. Patrick Larrimer was the exception. He recognized & respected our small business needs of a multi flex unit at a reasonable price. Once we decided on the property that fulfilled our business needs, Patrick made the process seamless and handled all necessary paperwork to expedite Urbn Timber settling into the new space. We would highly recommend Patrick for your Commercial Real Estate needs and will be using him in the future as our business expands."
