								h5 What is a favorite pastime you enjoy?
								p In my free time I like to hang out with my husband and dog, be active playing sports and running, and make crafts with pallets.
								h5 Who are your favorite sports teams?
								p I enjoy watching Ohio State football and the Barclayâ€™s Premier League. I really enjoyed watching Leicester City beat the odds and win in 2016.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p I love the Columbus Metro Parks. They are a nature retreat in the middle of the city with lots of trails to explore. One day I was on a trail run and I crossed paths with a Turkey.
