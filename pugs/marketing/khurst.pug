								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p I moved here to attend OSU in 2010 and fell in love with the city immediately. I contemplated moving away after graduation, but quickly changed my mind when I saw how the city was changing and growing rapidly. I couldn’t imagine living anywhere else now.
								h5 What is your favorite neighborhood/area of Columbus?
								p Italian Village – I live in the neighborhood and love all of the hidden gem restaurants, shops and bars tucked into the neighborhood away from High Street.
								h5 Who are your favorite sports teams?
								p Ohio State Buckeyes, of course. And Columbus Crew – I’m a season ticket member!
