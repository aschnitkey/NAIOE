								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p After graduating from college, I dappled with the idea of moving away from Columbus. After a year of considering this, I suddenly realized how much I loved the neighborhoods and different activities that Columbus has to offer, not to mention the fabulous summertime festivals! Looking back, I was chasing an idea of what I wanted in a city and when I looked around, all the things I wanted were right here.
								h5 What is your favorite neighborhood of Columbus?
								p Although I live in Italian Village, which is right in the middle of the Short North, I will always love my first neighborhood I lived in right after college, which is German Village. I love all the hidden alleys, restaurants within the neighborhood and brick streets.
								h5 What is a favorite pastime you enjoy?
								p I (almost) never miss a Barre class at 7 Studios. If you ever want to find me on a Monday night at 6, thatâ€™s where I will be!
