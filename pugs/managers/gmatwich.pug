								h5 What has been the best part of Columbusâ€™ growth over the past few decades?
								p It has been wonderful to see the City develop its own identity separate from the university. I feel like many of the graduates that would have fled to other cities in the past are now drawn to Columbus thanks to the high quality of life and cost of living.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation? 
								p I was lucky enough to take my family to Wyoming to visit the Grand Tetons and parts of Yellowstone National Park in 2021. I was fortunate enough to go as a child myself which made this extra special. Taking the ferry across Jenny Lake for a family hike was the highlight of our trip. 
								h5 Who are your favorite sports teams? 
								p I inherited the heartache that is being a Cleveland sports fan. The lone bright spot was celebrating the Cavaliers 2016 NBA Championship in Cleveland with my son with many losing Browns seasons in between.
