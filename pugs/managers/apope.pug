								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p Hilliard was my hometown for over 30 years until our recent move into nearby Dublin. Columbus has experienced a huge growth in recent years, and we enjoy exploring the local areas and their endless entertainment options.
								h5 What is your favorite Columbus neighborhood?
								p I would consider my favorite area a tie between Bridge Park in Dublin and Old Hilliard. Both locations feature several of our favorite local restaurants and the walkability in each spot makes it even better during the warmer months in Columbus.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p Like many, the beach! Our go to destination is St. Pete Beach, Florida to kick back and relax.
								h5 Who are your favorite sports teams?
								p The Ohio State Buckeyes and Cleveland Guardians
