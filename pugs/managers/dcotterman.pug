								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p It has always felt like home, even when I spent time away. It is the perfect blend of big city, small town, surrounded by beautiful country and very family friendly.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p Coastal South Carolina. I have spent at least one week per year on the same island in the South Carolina low country since I was 4 years old, it’s hard to define until you’ve travelled there; but it is a unique and very relaxing experience.
