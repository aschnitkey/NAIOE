								h5 If you had to pick a song to walk-out to (similar to baseball), what would it be? 
								p "Stronger" by Kanye West - I chose this song because the lyrics talk about overcoming challenges and becoming stronger as a result.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home? 
								p Born and raised in Columbus.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation? 
								p I enjoy traveling to Mexico for so many reasons! I love immersing myself in the vibrant culture, soaking in the stunning ocean views, indulging in delicious food, and the warm hospitality. 
								h5 Whatâ€™s a favorite pastime you enjoy? 
								p For the past 24 years, I have enjoyed spending time traveling with my four children for soccer. Sadly, that has recently ended so now my time is spent at the gym and cherishing every moment with my family. Life is a gift, so I never take a single day for granted
