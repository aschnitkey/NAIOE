								hr
								h5 Why did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?
								p I enjoy the diversity of projects to work on, the variety of property, the challenge of creating a successful management plan, working with creative people, and an ever evolving industry.  Every hour of every business day can be unique.
								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p I am originally from Reynoldsburg and relocated to North Carolina and Florida for a period of time. I eventually made my way back to central Ohio since a majority of my family resides here and because I just love the Midwest in autumn.
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p One of my favorite vacation spots is the Outer Banks in Duck, North Carolina. All my brothers and sisters get together, we rent a huge house and spend a full week together with all our children. We could do this anywhere, but we all love the beach and ocean-oriented activities and it keeps us close.
								h5 What is a favorite pastime you enjoy?
								p I enjoy reading fiction novels, experiencing life with my grandchild, watching OSU football games, spending quality time with my busy children and fitness exercising.
								h5 Who are your favorite sports teams?
								p The Ohio State University football team.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p I cannot tell you, it would not be hidden any longer.
