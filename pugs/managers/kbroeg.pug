								h5 Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?
								p I was born in Columbus but moved away at a young age and grew up in Northern, Ohio. After attending school at BGSU, I relocated to a couple of different cities but knew I always wanted to end up back in Columbus to live near my family. I love Columbus and all that this great city has to offer!
								h5 Where do you like to vacation?
								p Everywhere! Traveling is my #1 favorite activity to do. My bucket list is multiple pages long, but, I feel fortunate that I have traveled to over 25 states, throughout Central America, the Caribbean and all throughout Europe.
								h5 What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?
								p The Yoga Factory in Westerville, OH â€“ the perfect way to relax at the end of a long day!
