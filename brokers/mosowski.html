                <h5>What do you like most about Commercial Real Estate?</h5>
                <p>The people and relationships. Everyone thinks we are just in sales, however, that is not entirely true.  Yes, sales are a part of the business, however the people and relationships are far more important than the next sale.  Getting to know my clients and what their problems are, what their motivation is, and what their pain points are allow me to fully understand their needs and deliver successful results.  The relationships that I have been able to make in this industry are irreplaceable. Conversations I have with my clients, peers, lenders, or appraisers tend to be 10% business and 90% catching up on each other’s lives or relationship building.</p>
                <h5>Describe a memorable transaction.</h5>
                <p>The sale of 800-830 Distribution Drive.  800-830 Distribution Drive was the first industrial property and industrial owner I ever worked for; the original assignment was to lease a 7,200 SF space.  During my first showing there I remember walking through the space in the dark using my flip phone as a light to find the breaker box, flipped the breakers for the lights and there was the sweet sound of the buzzing Metal Halide lighting.  I leased that space, and over the next 10 years I re-leased that space twice more, and also leased the other 52,800 SF in those buildings multiple times over.  I discussed selling the building with the owner many times over the years and finally in 2016 it was time. We put the building in contract three times, twice it fell out and finally the third time it sold.  My client (Jerry) was the first industrial owner I had ever worked for and we had developed a decade long relationship, so when it was time to sell it was a bit bittersweet.

                <h5>Why did you decide to make Central Ohio your home? </h5>
                <p>My move to Columbus was supposed to be temporary, however after living here for a couple months and seeing the growth potential, I decided to stay.  Growing up outside of Cleveland was fine, however, in the early 2000s my hometown was headed downward and Columbus upward.  It was a new city with a ton of energy and excitement I did not see back home, and those trends have continued and I believe will continue for a while.</p>
                <h5>What is your favorite area of Central Ohio?</h5>
                <p>My favorite area is where I currently live: Alexandria. It is one of the few remaining one-stoplight towns left in our ever-growing region.  It is a quiet little country town where all the businesses are local and they know who you are when you walk in the door.  Everyone takes great pride in the area, whether your family has lived there 100 years or, like us, moved there to get out of the city.</p>
                <h5>Where do you like to vacation?</h5>
                <p>Tennessee – On one side you can visit the mountains, hike, see wildlife and spend time in nature, and on the other side there is Nashville, which is a super cool city with lots to do.  It is also an easy drive from Columbus and there is something for everyone in the family to do.</p>
                <h5>What’s a favorite pastime you enjoy?</h5>
                <p>Spending time with my family is absolutely the best part of any day!  My wife and two daughters keep me going on a daily basis and anytime with them is cherished.</p>
                <h5>Who are your favorite sports teams?</h5>
                <p>Stewart Hass Racing.  I have been a Tony Stewart fan since day 1, and now that he is retired, I’m a fan of any driver that races for his team.</p>
                <h5>What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?</h5>
                <p>With the internet and sites like Columbus Underground, it’s hard to say there are any hidden gems left in Columbus.  However, in Alexandria we have a little bar/restaurant called the Hawks Nest that serves beer and wine only and the food isn’t that good, but its close and the people are great.</p>

Each time they understood our need to be in a specific geographic area and knew there were limited options that would fit our requirement.  They completed an extensive search, organized the data, and prepared it so it was easy for me to review.  Once a building was chosen, they assisted in the lease negotiation. Their market knowledge is invaluable and key to us feeling confident in our decisions.  I would be happy to recommend them to anyone with industrial needs in the area."</p>

Whether it is helping to locate a short term warehouse space or assisting in selling our buildings, their dedication to representing our best interests has always been appreciated.  We have asked the Industrial Property Team to do a little of everything over the years and the Industrial Property Team have treated each assignment with equal importance.  From leasing 20,000 SF on a month-to month basis or selling our 340,000 SF Class A building. Their commitment, determination and market knowledge allowed us to achieve our goals.<br><br>One of their most important traits is their honesty.  It is difficult in these times to maintain a moral compass.  Theirs is fine-tuned and on the mark all the time. When we combine this trait with their loyalty, it sets the Industrial Property Team head and shoulders above all others.
