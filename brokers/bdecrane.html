                <h5>What do you like most about Commercial Real Estate?</h5>
                <p>I like that each day is different and the new relationships that are constantly being made.</p>
                <h5>Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?</h5>
                <p>After spending time traveling and attending school out of state, I always found myself wanting to return to my hometown.</p>
                <h5>What is a favorite pastime you enjoy?</h5>
                <p>My favorite pastime is enjoying long family dinners. I consider myself extremely lucky to be close with my family, and it is time I do not take for granted.</p>
                <h5>What is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?</h5>
                <p>Club 185 – it may not be much of a hidden gem but its my go-to hangout spot nestled in my favorite neighborhood, German Village.</p>
                <h5>Who are your favorite sports teams?</h5>
                <p>My three favorite sports to watch are individual sports (golf, boxing, and mixed martial arts). In all three I find it difficult to pick a favorite because I love learning about all their respective stories and backgrounds.</p>
                <h5>Where do you like to vacation? Why?</h5>
                <p>My significant other and I try to vacation in different places each year. There are so many amazing places to explore, and I have found that if you didn’t have a good time in a place, it was a you problem and not a problem with the place.</p>
                <h5>If you had to pick a song to walk-up to (similar to baseball), what would it be?</h5>
                <p>No music. Was there anything more intimidating than Mike Tyson walking to the ring with no music?</p>

Each time they understood our need to be in a specific geographic area and knew there were limited options that would fit our requirement.  They completed an extensive search, organized the data, and prepared it so it was easy for me to review.  Once a building was chosen, they assisted in the lease negotiation. Their market knowledge is invaluable and key to us feeling confident in our decisions.  I would be happy to recommend them to anyone with industrial needs in the area."</p>

After purchasing Southeast Industrial Park, our goal has been to sell the buildings individually. Their team has clearly communicated our objectives to the brokerage community and end users.

The Industrial Property Team have consistently understood our business and its challenges. Whether it is helping to locate a short term warehouse space or assisting in selling our buildings, their dedication to representing our best interests has always been appreciated.  We have asked the Industrial Property Team to do a little of everything over the years and the Industrial Property Team have treated each assignment with equal importance.  From leasing 20,000 SF on a month-to month basis or selling our 340,000 SF Class A building. Their commitment, determination and market knowledge allowed us to achieve our goals.<br><br>One of their most important traits is their honesty.  It is difficult in these times to maintain a moral compass.  Theirs is fine-tuned and on the mark all the time. When we combine this trait with their loyalty, it sets the Industrial Property Team head and shoulders above all others.  My business partner and I really appreciated all of their good work and dependability.<br><br>We truly enjoy working with the Industrial Property Team and would highly recommend the Industrial Property Team to anyone with warehouse needs in the Central Ohio area or other parts of the country."</p>

Over this period of time, the Industrial Property Team have represented us with several building acquisitions, both in Ohio and across the country, and with each new project, the Industrial Property Team have always taken the time to understand our thoughts and negotiate with our interests in mind.  Honestly, it is very comforting to work with someone you can trust and who works so hard to achieve the goals we target.  I sincerely appreciate the partnership and drive the Industrial Property Team bring with each new project. <br><br>Please also know that without question, I would highly recommend the Industrial Property Team to anyone looking to complete a real estate project anywhere in the country."</p>
