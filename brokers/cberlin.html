                <h5>What do you enjoy most about Commercial Real Estate?</h5>
                <p>That it’s not really all about selling. I try to put myself into my clients’ shoes and spend more time consulting with them than on sales. Our goal is to make sure every deal fits into our client’s business model so they can continue to be successful. </p>
                <h5>Why did you decide to make Columbus your home?</h5>
                <p>My family is located here so I wanted to stay in Columbus to be close to them and build my own family in the city I grew up in.</p>
                <h5>What is a favorite pastime you enjoy?</h5>
                <p>Fishing. As I have grown older I think it and brokerage have a lot in common. Casting is like cold calling. Most times there is nothing on the end of the line. However, when you do catch something or get a positive response it is exhilarating and it keeps you coming back for more.</p>
                <h5>Who are your favorite sports teams?</h5>
                <p>The Ohio State Buckeyes, St. Louis Cardinals, Kansas City Chiefs and Columbus Blue Jackets</p>

Each time he understood our need to be in a specific geographic area and knew there were limited options that would fit our requirement.  He completed an extensive search, organized the data, and prepared it so it was easy for me to review.  Once a building was chosen, he assisted in the lease negotiation.  His market knowledge is invaluable and key to us feeling confident in our decisions.  I would be happy to recommend him to anyone with industrial needs in the area."</p>

We have asked you to do a little of everything over the years and you have treated each assignment with equal importance.  From leasing 20,000 SF on a month-to month basis or selling our 340,000 SF Class A building. Your commitment, determination and market knowledge allowed us to achieve our goals.<br><br>One of your most important traits is your honesty.  It is difficult in these times to maintain a moral compass.  Yours is fine-tuned and on the mark all the time.

Over this period of time, you have represented us with several building acquisitions, both in Ohio and across the country, and with each new project, you have always taken the time to understand our thoughts and negotiate with our interests in mind.
