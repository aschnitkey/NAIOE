            <h2>Designations in Commercial Real Estate</h2>
            <p>At NAI Ohio Equities, we pride ourselves on being the top Commercial Real Estate company in Central Ohio. Many of our agents have put in time and energy to achieve industry designations, such as CCIM, SIOR or CPM. Those agents stand out from the crowd and provide a high level of service with our industry and company.</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3 class="red">Degrees and Designations</h3>
                <p>Other than the Ohio and National Real Estate exam, there are no designations required to practice as a commercial real estate broker (unlike with an attorney, engineer, architect or doctor). Because of this, commercial real estate associations have created specialized professional designations that allow you to identify those practitioners who have gone above and beyond. These help the best stand out from the rest and can guide you through the complex process of buying and selling commercial real estate.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3 class="red">Commercial Real Estate Designations</h3>
                <p>The two most common designations are CCIM and SIOR. CCIM designation stands for Certified Commerical Investment Member. The CCIM pin signifies the agent has completed advanced courses in the market and financial analysis and has demonstrated significant experience in the commercial real estate industry.</p>
                <p>The other common designation is SIOR, which stands for Society of Industrial and Office Realtors. This designation is a professional achievement for those who have a strong history in fee-based services, brokerage or executive management. They must be a specialist in office or industrial markets, close more than 30 transactions/year and meet education, production, and ethical requirements.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3 class="red">Pick the Right Broker</h3>
                <p>These professional designations signify an ongoing commitment to market trends, industry knowledge, and life-long learning. When choosing an agent, it makes sense to find one that has a designation that signified years of knowledge and experience. Let us know how we can help match you with the right agent for the job!</p>

          <h1>Market Reports</h1>
          <p>The central Ohio commercial real estate market continues to heat up, with both office and industrial vacancy rates remain relatively flat. Although counterintuitive, we don’t expect to see significant reductions in vacancy even as demand increases. The reason: much of the current available space is the same space that has been undesired by tenants for years due to lack of amenities and functional obsolescence.</p>
          <p>So if vacancy is not falling, what indicators do we have to show the market is truly “hot”?</p>

          <p>“The rec center will send out requests to all the local area schools to the children that may be less than privileged during this time of year,” explains Michael. “Then, a group of us will organize the community to fulfill the wish list.”</p>
