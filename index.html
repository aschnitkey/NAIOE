          <h1>Market Reports</h1>
          <h4>Office Overview</h4>
          <p>Columbus office vacancy sits at 10.2% compared to the national average of 13.7% and rent growth remains solid, with Columbus seeing annual gains of 2.3% compared to the national benchmark of 0.7%. Office footprints have shrunk to 3,600 square feet, 10% less than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
          <p>Rent growth is at 2.3%; a byproduct of large Tenant Improvement (TI) packages and abated rent concessions to keep rates from dropping.</p>
          <p>TI packages have become equally or more important than rental rate; suggesting rent growth will continue.</p>
          <p>Medical office leasing remains steady in Class A MOBs.</p>
          <p>Medical office continues to attract investment and maintaining stronger cap rates in the 6-7.5% range versus the 9-10.5% range in general office.</p>
          <p class="red">-------------------------</p>
          <p><em>“'Can this suite be demised?’ This is a common question when the average tenant in today’s market only needs 3,600 square feet. Landlords are all competing to win the “small deals”; most are shorter term but still require hefty TI packages. Landlords are signing these deals, less for a large profit today, but rather banking on the traditionally much lower cost lease renewal. These smaller leases all add up and chip away at vacancy. They come with ancillary benefits such as rent roll diversification and greater expansion opportunities throughout the occupancy lifecycle.” - <strong>Andy Dutcher</strong>, Senior VP, Office Brokerage</em></p>

          <p class="news-date">February 27, 2024</p>
          <p>If you’ve been using the same vendor for years without bidding out the service contract, you could be doing yourself a disservice. As a property management company, bidding out service contracts for our clients is a valuable tool that creates a balance between maintaining quality service and optimizing costs. In this blog post, we delve into the benefits of bidding out service contracts, including which services to start with and the frequency.</p>
          <h4>REASONS FOR PERIODICALLY BIDDING OUT SERVICE CONTRACTS</h4><strong>Cost Savings</strong>
          <p>Regularly bidding out service contracts ensures you receive the most competitive pricing from vendors, often resulting in lower costs and better terms. Commercial Property Manager Mary Brown says when soliciting bids, it’s important to use companies that have been vetted, meaning you are familiar with the quality of their service and have already established that their pricing is fair. Unfamiliar companies that have not been vetted may not have the appropriate scope for the property and may submit the lowest bid to earn the business but may not be able to offer comparable quality.</p><strong>Ensuring Quality Service</strong>
          <p>Periodic bidding, even if you are happy with the service you have, offers a chance to assess quality and offerings from both your current vendor and potential vendors. This process ensures you have thoroughly considered your vendor’s performance and allows you to seek references and evaluate proposals to compare services. This can result in enhanced tenant satisfaction and in some instances, increased property value.</p>

          <p class="news-date">January 30, 2024</p>
          <p>The $1.78 billion verdict in October against the National Association of REALTORS® has sent shockwaves across the residential real estate industry. The ruling in the case of Sitzer/Burnett v. The National Association of Realtors et al, including Compass Inc., EXP World Holdings Inc., Redfin Corp., Weichert Realtors, United Real Estate, Howard Hanna Real Estate Services, and Douglas Elliman Inc., claimed that the NARs “participation rule” and “cooperative compensation” practices forced home sellers to pay inflated commissions to buyer agents. Within hours of the verdict, the plaintiff attorneys in the case filed a separate class-action lawsuit against another set of companies with the same allegations.</p>
          <p>Anywhere Real Estate Inc., the parent company of Coldwell Banker, also agreed in early October to pay $83.5 million to settle a pair of class-action lawsuits and to overhaul its policies toward commissions. RE/MAX Holdings Inc. has separately agreed to pay $55 million. Since then, the residential real estate world has been reeling as brokerages navigate the appeals process and reformation of their existing commission practices.</p>
          <p>Many have asked us if and how these rulings will affect commercial compensation practices and what impact these rulings will have overall. To answer this question, it is important to understand the different views and practices in the residential and commercial industries which we believe, in part, influenced this decision and its outcomes.</p><strong>Multiple Listing Services</strong>
          <p>Multiple Listing Services or “MLS”, were created as a way to share information about listings for residential real estate. They serve as a single source of listing information for a market, and that information is easily accessible to the consumer.</p>

          <p class="news-date">November 30, 2023</p>
          <p>One of the most common questions asked by office tenants during the leasing process is how to proceed with evaluating the costs associated with tenant improvements and how that expense factors into their negotiation and decision-making process. After all, you can’t be entirely clear on the cost of the lease without understanding the expense associated with any improvements that will be needed. With the proper planning, strong representation, experienced contractors, and some insight, you can manage this process in a way that is effective and results in a clear understanding of your costs!</p><strong>Step 1: Narrow Your List</strong>
          <p>To begin, hone in on what your needs are versus your wants for the space and narrow down your search to the top two to three options. Having a short list will help to simplify your ability to compare and contrast your total cost for each space.</p><strong>Step 2: Develop a Space Plan</strong>
          <p>A space plan is a detailed layout or design that shows the contractor how you intend to use your space. The best way to do this is to hire an architect or work with the building architect. Sometimes, a tenant will create a space plan without an architect, however, this can cause inefficiency. Ideally, your space plan will reflect the most current floor plan, along with details about the finishes, plumbing and electrical changes, and which walls would be removed and where new construction would be needed. The more detail included enables the contractor to provide the most accurate estimate, which prevents inflated estimates and surprises later.</p>
