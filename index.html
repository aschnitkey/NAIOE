          <h1>Market Reports</h1>
          <h4>Office Overview</h4>
          <p>Office vacancy in Columbus is rising slower than the national average, at 9.4%, compared to 13.9% nationally, due to limited new projects and positive absorption. New lease sizes in Columbus are modestly shrinking, but expansions by companies like BBI Logistics offset this trend. </p>
          <p>Vacancy Rate Trends: The Columbus office market saw a gradual increase in the vacancy rate to 9.4% in Q4 2024, up 60 basis points year-over-year, continuing to outperform the national vacancy rate of 13.9% due to limited new deliveries​.</p>
          <p>Leasing Activity: Leasing volumes in Q4 remained muted, with significant tenant downsizing and relocations contributing to the return of 240,000 SF of space to the market over the past year​</p>
          <p>Rent Performance: Rent growth decelerated further to 1.1% in Q4 2024, down from 1.8% in Q3, but still outpacing the national benchmark of 1.0%. Tenant concessions and competitive sublease options continued to pressure rents​.</p>
          <p>Construction Pipeline: With minimal new projects breaking ground, the Columbus construction pipeline remains at its lowest level in over a decade, with a little over 400,000 SF currently under construction, primarily in mixed-use developments​.</p>
          <p class="red">-------------------------</p>
          <p><em>“As we close out 2024, the Columbus office market demonstrates resilience amidst national headwinds. Limited new construction has kept vacancy increases modest, while tenants prioritize quality over quantity in their space decisions. Although rent growth has softened, Columbus continues to offer a competitive edge with its stable market conditions and future growth potential."<br><strong>- Matt Gregory</strong>, Managing Director</em></p>

          <p class="news-date">November 21, 2024</p>
          <p>As winter approaches in Ohio, ensuring that your commercial property is ready for the season isn’t just an option—it’s a necessity. With our expert guidance, you can prepare your commercial property for Ohio’s winter months and safeguard your investment. Simply adding these five steps to your commercial property checklist will help you to avoid costly issues, maintain operational efficiency and enhance the comfort and safety of everyone who steps foot on your property during the winter months.</p><strong>INSPECT AND SERVICE HVAC SYSTEMS</strong>
          <p>Maintaining a fully functional HVAC system is key to surviving Ohio’s cold snaps. If it’s going to happen – it usually happens when the thermometer approaches zero. But with a little preparation, you can circumvent surprises. By scheduling a seasonal inspection, you can ensure you’re aware of any problems that could potentially arise. It’s also a good idea to replace air filters and inspect ductwork to prevent uneven heating or airflow issues. Additionally, consider upgrading your thermostat for efficiency. Many newer thermostats allow you to monitor building temperatures remotely and have automated settings.</p><strong>SEAL WINDOWS AND DOORS TO MAXIMIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY</strong>
          <p>Preventing drafts is one of the simplest ways to reduce energy consumption and skyrocketing energy costs in the winter months. Take the time to inspect all openings for cracks or gaps and apply weather stripping or caulk to problem areas.</p>

          <p class="news-date">September 17, 2024</p>
          <p>Interest rates are currently at their highest level in over two decades, yet inflation persists. Though many had hoped interest rate cuts were on the horizon as early as June, the Federal Reserve hasn’t been comfortable doing so just yet, with analysts expecting it to be September before the first cut.</p>
          <p>The current climate has commercial real estate owners, occupiers, investors, and developers sidelined and anxiously awaiting news that inflation has been tamed and the economy is stabilizing. But it may not all hinge on interest rates coming down.</p>
          <p>The higher cost of funds along with several other market challenges could impact lending for longer than expected.</p><strong>A Perfect Storm</strong>
          <p>“Over the past year, we’ve felt the impact of the enormous influx of capital that was injected into the economy during the pandemic,” said Travis McIntyre, vice president at Park National Bank.</p>
          <p>The issuance of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans during the pandemic, and subsequently Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) intended to save businesses from the immediate impact of the pandemic, allowed many small businesses to pay down existing pre-pandemic loans early, and in some instances, stop turning to banks for new loans.</p>

          <p class="news-date">August 27, 2024</p>
          <p>Columbus City Council officially adopted changes to the city’s zoning code in July. The change marks the first significant evaluation and reformation of the prior code in more than 70 years. The years-long effort culminated in a unanimous vote for all six resolutions and the legislation is slated to take effect on August 28. As a result, six mixed-use districts were created along key corridors of the city, incentivizing the development of up to 88,000 housing units. Here’s what the change means for commercial real estate.</p><strong>ELIMINATING PARKING REQUIREMENTS, RELAXED DENSITY AND HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS MAKE DEVELOPMENT MORE COST-EFFECTIVE</strong>
          <p>The Columbus region is experiencing a housing shortage. A 2017 study conducted by Vogt Strategic Insights on behalf of the Building Industry Association of Central Ohio evaluated the region’s housing needs through 2050 and found that the region needs to build 14,000 housing units annually through 2050 to meet the needs of the growing Columbus region. Between 2010 and 2021, the Columbus MSA has averaged 8,214 permits per year, according to the report. This challenge has been exacerbated following the announcement that Intel would build its campus in the region bringing the estimated population growth in the region to nearly 3 million by 2050.</p>
