          <p class="news-date">July 9, 2020</p>
          <p>As WFH continues to dominate today’s business scene, offices are facing many unprecedented challenges. Teams are teleworking, the office space is snoozing, and even after two months, there’s no official word yet on when things will be back to ‘normal’.</p>
          <p>With uncertainty on the radar and no clear end to COVID-19 in sight, office lease renewals will definitely pose a challenge for many landlords and property owners. Let’s take a deeper look at the details to gauge exactly what the industry is dealing with:</p><strong>Tenant Troubles</strong>
          <p>A real estate field can only be as strong as their tenants - and right now, the office pool is in the weeds. With the economy slowing down due to coronavirus implications, many companies aren’t seeing the gains they’ve gotten used to during the United States’ longest streak of economic expansion - that we’ve just fallen out of.</p>
          <p>Resultantly, a substantial number of office tenants may not be able to renew their leases. Some companies are taking a break to see how things play out, but others are calling it quits altogether. Others are skipping out on rent altogether, causing serious cut-backs into rental profits.</p>

          <p>What hasn’t COVID disrupted? At this point, the shocking headlines exploring the ways the coronavirus is impacting the world has become the ‘new normal.’</p>
          <p>It’s clear that the virus has made waves everywhere, but the one thing everyone is keeping an eye on is the industrial sector.</p>
