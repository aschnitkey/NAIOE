            <h2>What Does the Smart City Mean For Our Future?</h2>
            <p>The Smart city market is projected to reach $400 billion by 2020. The type of data analysis that is made possible through Smart cities will become invaluable for identifying prospective investments, new or re-development, attracting tenants, and building better infrastructure.</p>
            <p>One tech leader, Cisco, is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/seattle/news/technology/the-more-information-the-better-in-cities-of-the-future-85699" target="_blank">Smart city projects all over the world</a> including in San Jose and Chicago. Electricity giant GE (General Electric) has joined with city governments in San Diego, CA and Jacksonville, FL to test pilot Smart cities there. Will this trend continue and what do these Smart city projects mean for our future?</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 class="red">Expect the Smart City Trend to Continue to Grow</h3>
                <p>Experts predict that Smart cities will become a nearly half a trillion dollar industry in less than two years. There are <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/smart-cities-6-essential-technologies/" target="_blank">plans to unveil about 600 Smart cities globally </a>over these next two years. In less than a decade Smart cities are estimated to account for 60% of the global GDP from these 600 cities alone.</p>

                <h3 class="red">Mobile Devices Will Connect People, Buildings, and Cities Together</h3>
                <p>In the future, All CRE properties will have to be built to connect with both people and the city itself. Real-time data will be essential in site planning, development, investment, and leasing. Being able to connect to a wide range of devices and technologies that are continuing to evolve and change will be an ongoing challenge for everyone in CRE.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 class="red">Reasons Smart Cities are a Win-Win-Win</h3>
                <p>Our future is going to be vastly more tech enhanced than it is right now – amazing when you consider how tech enhanced everything already is. But what Smart cities are expected to do is go beyond providing more convenience to citizens and consumers. They are going to be more efficient, use less energy, and control everything from street lights to the city’s Smart electrical grid.</p>
                <p>Imagine a bus stop that tells you when the next bus is coming in real-time and will re-route you automatically without you interacting at all. Your mobile device will announce it like the weather when you pass a bus stop’s beacons and sensors.</p>
                <p>No longer will pedestrians have to stand and wait for five minutes to cross a busy street. Sensors will detect pedestrians and will change traffic lights in real-time for optimal traffic flow. Uber apps will send driverless cars when you step into an Uber pickup zone with your mobile device – all because of beacons and sensors in street lights, traffic lights, crosswalks, and city cameras.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 class="red">What Smart Cities Mean for the Future of CRE</h3>
                <p>Predictive analysis today is child’s play compared to what we expect in the future. Imagine how much useful data will be collected when Smart cities are also filled with Smart buildings that can communicate with city assets as well as consumers, employees, and citizens.</p>
                <p>When it comes to site planning, the types of real-time and historic data that can be collected based on actual foot traffic over long periods of time will be insanely invaluable in the future. Seattle is already a Smart city and is experimenting with and testing new ways of interacting with its citizens through Smart technology to make life better.</p>

          <p class="news-date">August 28, 2018</p>
          <p>With the recent explosion of scooter companies coming into Columbus, we are left questioning how these rental companies will impact our cities for years to come.</p>
          <p>You’re not just seeing things – rental transportation is becoming ever more of a popular thing by the day, particularly in larger metropolitan areas. Just as much as they are getting big, they’re also becoming controversial, with some cities fighting back with claims that these scooters clutter the community and are not tightly regulated enough. They’re everywhere, officials say. They’re convenient, claim the companies, in places where parking is a bear and even public transport can be challenging.</p>
          <p>So where to from here? How will the advent of rental transportation impact our cities going forward?</p>

          <p class="news-date">August 7, 2018</p>
          <p>Starting the business was the hard part. Now you are looking for space but how do you find the right commercial building? You need a good commercial real estate brokerage but each brokerage and broker is different. How do you choose the one that’s right for you? Here are 4 things to look for:</p>
          <p><strong>#1: A broker that specializes in the type of commercial property that you need.</strong></p>
          <p>One of the first things you’ll come up against when you start looking for commercial property is zoning. You may think that your office building could fit perfectly in a vacant restaurant or retail shop but is it zoned for that? Businesses that will use a building for industrial use have to find a property that is zoned for industrial use just like any other type of commercial business.</p>

          <p class="news-date">July 31, 2018</p>
          <p>WeWork started the concept but it has only grown and expanded from there. The co-working or flex space model which began in NYC is fast becoming the new Uber of commercial office space. With large corporations abandoning the traditional work model for more flex space, it is changing how landlords attract and retain tenants.</p>
          <p>Recently, landlords are discovering that they can use their building’s flex space as an amenity to attract tenants. Flex space isn’t just a coworking hub: it is bookable meeting space, conference rooms, event space, and multimedia rooms. Tenants are also demanding more from flex space operators. Here are 5 reasons why landlords should view flexible space as an amenity for their tenants.</p>
