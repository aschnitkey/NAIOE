								<dt>Generates Cash and Improves Liquidity</dt>

								<dd>Many companies earn a higher return on capital placed in their primary business instead of investing in the real estate they occupy.</dd>
								<dt>Maximum Value</dt>
								<dd>Some corporations that anticipate the retirement of key personnel are potential prospects for a sale-leaseback. Selling the real estate ahead of selling the business can often maximize the sale proceeds from both.</dd>
								<dt>Improves the Balance Sheet</dt>
								<dd>The seller replaces the real estate (a capital asset) with the cash proceeds from the sale. The rent obligation is usually footnoted on the balance sheet rather than as a liability, resulting in an increase in the seller’s assets to liability ratio.</dd>
								<dt>Avoid Conventional Fees</dt>

								<dt>Deduction of Rental Payments</dt>
								<dd>The main tax advantage of a valid sale-leaseback is that rental payments under the lease are fully deductible. With conventional mortgage financing, a borrower deducts interest and depreciation only. Also, in contrast to a conventional mortgage, a rental deduction allows the user to effectively depreciate the land as the lease payments cover the use of the land and the building.</dd>
								<dt>Timing Gain and Loss Recognition</dt>
								<dd>A seller can use a sale-leaseback to time the recognition of gains or losses while retaining the use of a property. A business may want to recognize gains to use business credits or net operating loss carryovers. If the business owns appreciated property, a sale of assets will produce a gain that could be offset by the credits or net operating loss carryovers. However, if the adjusted basis of the assets exceeds its fair market value, a recognized loss will reduce tax liability.</dd>
								<dt>Capital Gain-Ordinary Loss Treatment</dt>
								<dd>Because the property involved in a sale-leaseback generally is held for use in the seller’s trade or business, it qualifies for capital gain-ordinary loss treatment. Under Section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code, if the property is held for the long-term holding period, gain on the sale, with some exceptions, will be taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that the gain exceeds the losses in the same year from the sale of other Section 1231 property. However, the gain will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of recapture income. But in the case that the sale results in a loss, it will be deductible in full as an ordinary loss to the extent the loss exceeds Section 1231 gains from the sale of other property in the sale year. This can be a substantial advantage to the seller in a sale-leaseback transaction.</dd>

			<div class="net-leased-investments-image"></div>
			<h4>Net-Leased Properties</h4>
			<p>A single tenant, net leased investment is usually a freestanding commercial property that is leased and occupied by one company. Normally the tenant has committed to a long-term lease with increasing rent over the term. In addition to rent, the tenant is required to pay utilities, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, common area maintenance, and repairs. This type of investment is appealing to a wide variety of buyers including individuals, companies, real estate investment trusts, and investors needing a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.</p>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h5>Advantages</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Maintains value in most circumstances</li>
					<li>Fewest owner responsibilities as tenant pays for most of the operating costs</li>
					<li>Typically have long term leases with increasing rent</li>
					<li>Access to better debt financing due to expected cash flows</li>
					<li>Property type preferred by investors</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h5>Disadvantages</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Cash flow depends on single tenant</li>
					<li>May be more expensive to build-out</li>
					<li>Could take more time to re-tenant</li>
					<li>Heavy competition for this property type</li>
					<li>Tenant's creditworthiness and investment in the property are important to long-term success</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h4>Valuation</h4>
			<p>In addition to the physical building and location, the property's value is determined by considering the tenant's credit, the length of the lease, and rental escalations over the term.</p>
